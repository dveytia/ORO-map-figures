# ORO-map-figures
Final figures for the systematic map on ocean-related-options

This project is organized into the following directories:
- analyses: for scripts to run analyses or produce figures
- figures: where output figures will be stored (in either the sub-directory "main" for main figures or "supplemental" for supplementary figures)
- data: any data that will be required to run the scripts. Note that individual data folders may come with a readme/description document to explain the format of the data
- outputs: any other outputs 
- R: .R scripts to source/run functions within the analyses scripts

In order to run the script, the .sqlite file containing the necessarily datatables needs to be downloaded from the repository: https://zenodo.org/records/13349908, and the file placed in the relative directory /data/sqlite-databases/
