abstract = {We document the configuration and emergent simulation features from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) OM4.0 ocean/sea ice model. OM4 serves as the ocean/sea ice component for the GFDL climate and Earth system models. It is also used for climate science research and is contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. The ocean component of OM4 uses version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model and the sea ice component uses version 2 of the Sea Ice Simulator, which have identical horizontal grid layouts (Arakawa C-grid). We follow the Coordinated Ocean-sea ice Reference Experiments protocol to assess simulation quality across a broad suite of climate-relevant features. We present results from two versions differing by horizontal grid spacing and physical parameterizations: OM4p5 has nominal 0.5° spacing and includes mesoscale eddy parameterizations and OM4p25 has nominal 0.25° spacing with no mesoscale eddy parameterization. Modular Ocean Model version 6 makes use of a vertical Lagrangian-remap algorithm that enables general vertical coordinates. We show that use of a hybrid depth-isopycnal coordinate reduces the middepth ocean warming drift commonly found in pure z* vertical coordinate ocean models. To test the need for the mesoscale eddy parameterization used in OM4p5, we examine the results from a simulation that removes the eddy parameterization. The water mass structure and model drift are physically degraded relative to OM4p5, thus supporting the key role for a mesoscale closure at this resolution.},

abstract = {The Antarctic ice sheet mass balance is a major component of the sea level budget and results from the difference of two fluxes of a similar magnitude: ice flow discharging in the ocean and net snow accumulation on the ice sheet surface, i.e. the surface mass balance (SMB). Separately modelling ice dynamics and SMB is the only way to project future trends. In addition, mass balance studies frequently use regional climate models (RCMs) outputs as an alternative to observed fields because SMB observations are particularly scarce on the ice sheet. Here we evaluate new simulations of the polar RCM MAR forced by three reanalyses, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2, for the period 1979-2015, and we compare MAR results to the last outputs of the RCM RACMO2 forced by ERA-Interim. We show that MAR and RACMO2 perform similarly well in simulating coast-to-plateau SMB gradients, and we find no significant differences in their simulated SMB when integrated over the ice sheet or its major basins. More importantly, we outline and quantify missing or underestimated processes in both RCMs. Along stake transects, we show that both models accumulate too much snow on crests, and not enough snow in valleys, as a result of drifting snow transport fluxes not included in MAR and probably underestimated in RACMO2 by a factor of 3. Our results tend to confirm that drifting snow transport and sublimation fluxes are much larger than previous model-based estimates and need to be better resolved and constrained in climate models. Sublimation of precipitating particles in low-level atmospheric layers is responsible for the significantly lower snowfall rates in MAR than in RACMO2 in katabatic channels at the ice sheet margins. Atmospheric sublimation in MAR represents 363 Gt yrĝ'1 over the grounded ice sheet for the year 2015, which is 16 {\%} of the simulated snowfall loaded at the ground. This estimate is consistent with a recent study based on precipitation radar observations and is more than twice as much as simulated in RACMO2 because of different time residence of precipitating particles in the atmosphere. The remaining spatial differences in snowfall between MAR and RACMO2 are attributed to differences in advection of precipitation with snowfall particles being likely advected too far inland in MAR.},

abstract = {Feedback between the Mediterranean Sea and the atmosphere on various temporal and spatial scales plays a major role in the regional climate system. We studied the impact of horizontal atmospheric grid resolution (grid-spacing of {\~{}}9 vs. {\~{}}50 km) and dynamic ocean coupling (the ocean model NEMOMED12) in simulations with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM. The evaluation focused on sea surface heat fluxes, 10-m wind speed, and sea surface temperature (SST) parameters on both seasonal and annual timescales. The finer grid improved the wind speed (particularly near coastal areas) and subsequently the turbulent heat flux simulations. Both parameters were better simulated with the interactive ocean model NEMOMED12 than with prescribed daily ocean SSTs (using near-observation ERA-Interim reanalysis based SSTs), but coupling introduced a warm SST bias in winter. Radiation fluxes were slightly better represented in coarse-grid simulations. Still, only the higher-resolution coupled simulations could reproduce the observed net outgoing total heat flux over the Mediterranean Sea. Investigation of the impact of sub-diurnal SST variations showed a strong effect on sub-daily heat fluxes and wind speed but minor effects at longer time scales. Therefore, a coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model should be preferred for studying the Mediterranean Sea climate system. Higher-resolution models should be preferred, but they are not yet able to perform better than their coarse-resolution predecessors in all aspects.},

abstract = {The "mass balance sensitivity" of a glacier provides a means for assessing its response to future warming and contribution to sea level rise. Many studies have concluded that the first-order control on mass balance sensitivity is climatic, where higher-precipitation (and less continental) glaciers are most sensitive while lower-precipitation (and more continental) glaciers are least sensitive. The Southern Alps in New Zealand experience a limited range of continentality (9-13 K) but strong gradients in precipitation (2.5-11 m a-1). Using an energy balance model applied on a regional scale we find that the central Southern Alps glaciers are very sensitive to temperature change (1.9 m w.e. a-1 K-1, with a range of -1.1 to -4.0 m w.e. a-1 K-1) and that an 82{\%} increase in precipitation is required to offset a 1 K warming. Spatial variations in mass balance sensitivity cannot be simply explained as a function of precipitation. Topographic effects are important, and we find that debris cover reduces mass balance sensitivity. Mass balance amplitude, which takes into account debris cover, hypsometry and other topographic characteristics, is a better predictor of mass balance sensitivity than precipitation. The mass balance gradient is almost as good a predictor indicating that hypsometry is not a necessary component of sensitivity calculations. Estimating mass balance sensitivity as a function of mass balance gradient allows for parameterizations of mass balance sensitivity based on glacier inventory data. This provides a simple and robust way to assess glacier mass balance sensitivity on a global scale, which may refine future predictions of valley glacier melt and its contribution to sea level rise.

The atmosphere model, known as AM2, includes a new gridpoint dynamical core, a prognostic cloud scheme, and a multispecies aerosol climatology, as well as components from previous models used at GFDL. The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2-LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One AM2-LM2 integration was perfor med according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). Particular strengths of AM2-LM2, as judged by comparison to other models participating in AMIP II, include its circulation and distributions of precipitation. Prominent problems of AM2-LM2 include a cold bias to surface and tropospheric temperatures, weak tropical cyclone activity, and weak tropical intraseasonal activity associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation. An ensemble of 10 AM2-LM 2 integrations with observed SSTs for the second half of the twentieth century permits a statistically reliable assessment of the model's response to ENSO. In general, AM2-LM2 produces a realistic simulation of the anomalies in tropical precipitation and extratropical circulation that are associated with ENSO. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Abstract Uncertainties in the 20th century carbon budget associated with the treatment of land use change (LUC) are assessed using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) first-generation Earth System Model (CanESM1). Eight coupled climate carbon cycle simulations are performed using different reconstructions of 1850–2000 land cover derived from historical information on changes in cropland and pasture area. The simulations provide estimates of the emissions associated with LUC, the relative contribution of changes in cropland and pasture to LUC emissions and the uncertainty associated with differences among historical data sets of crop area as well as in the manner in which the historical land cover data are constructed. The resulting estimates of the amount of biomass deforested over the 1850–2000 period range from 63 to 145 Pg C with cumulative implied LUC emissions ranging from 40 to 77 Pg C. These values of LUC emissions are considerably lower than Houghton's estimate of 156 Pg C. The year 2000 atmospheric CO2 concentration ranges between 371.1 ± 3.7 ppm depending on the data set used and the manner in which historical land cover is constructed. This compares to the observed value of 369.6 ppm at Mauna Loa and is 17.3 ± 6.3 ppm larger than for simulations without LUC. Although increases in cropland result in the expected increase in LUC emissions, changes in pasture area decrease these emissions because of carbon sequestration in soils.},

The model is applied to an area encompassing the Mediterranean Sea and compared to a stand-alone version of its atmospheric component. An assessment of the model performances is done by using available observational datasets. Despite a persistent bias, the PROTHEUS system is able to capture the inter-annual variability of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) and also the fine scale spatio-temporal evolution of observed SST anomalies, with spatial correlation as high as 0.7 during summer. The close inspection of a 10-day strong wind event during the summer of 2000 proves the capability of the PROTHEUS system to correctly describe the daily evolution of SST under strong air-sea interaction conditions. As a consequence of the model's skill in reproducing observed SST and wind fields, we expect a reliable estimation of air-sea fluxes. The model skill in reproducing climatological land surface fields is in line with that of state of the art regional climate models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Quantifying future dynamic contributions to sea level requires accurate portrayal of outlet glaciers in ice sheet simulations, but to date poor knowledge of subglacial topography and limited model resolution have prevented reproduction of complex spatial patterns of outlet flow. Here we combine a high-resolution ice-sheet model coupled to uniformly applied models of subglacial hydrology and basal sliding, and a new subglacial topography data set to simulate the flow of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Flow patterns of many outlet glaciers are well captured, illustrating fundamental commonalities in outlet glacier flow and highlighting the importance of efforts to map subglacial topography. Success in reproducing present day flow patterns shows the potential for prognostic modelling of ice sheets without the need for spatially varying parameters with uncertain time evolution.},

The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are 24 prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod-quota formalism. On the one hand, stoichiometry of C / N / P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicon quotas are variable and the growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting, for instance, the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady-state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data.

abstract = {The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)'s Working Group on Climate Modelling (WGCM) Infrastructure Panel (WIP) was formed in 2014 in response to the explosive growth in size and complexity of Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs) between CMIP3 (2005-2006) and CMIP5 (2011-2012). This article presents the WIP recommendations for the global data infrastructure needed to support CMIP design, future growth, and evolution. Developed in close coordination with those who build and run the existing infrastructure (the Earth System Grid Federation; ESGF), the recommendations are based on several principles beginning with the need to separate requirements, implementation, and operations. Other important principles include the consideration of the diversity of community needs around data-a data ecosystem-the importance of provenance, the need for automation, and the obligation to measure costs and benefits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper concentrates on requirements, recognizing the diversity of communities involved (modelers, analysts, software developers, and downstream users). Such requirements include the need for scientific reproducibility and accountability alongside the need to record and track data usage. One key element is to generate a dataset-centric rather than system-centric focus, with an aim to making the infrastructure less prone to systemic failure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}With these overarching principles and requirements, the WIP has produced a set of position papers, which are summarized in the latter pages of this document. They provide specifications for managing and delivering model output, including strategies for replication and versioning, licensing, data quality assurance, citation, long-Term archiving, and dataset tracking. They also describe a new and more formal approach for specifying what data, and associated metadata, should be saved, which enables future data volumes to be estimated, particularly for well-defined projects such as CMIP6.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper concludes with a future facing consideration of the global data infrastructure evolution that follows from the blurring of boundaries between climate and weather, and the changing nature of published scientific results in the digital age.},

abstract = {The Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (TESSEL) is used operationally in the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) for describing the evolution of soil, vegetation, and snow over the continents at diverse spatial resolutions. A revised land surface hydrology (H-TESSEL) is introduced in the ECMWF operational model to address shortcomings of the land surface scheme, specifically the lack of surface runoff and the choice of a global uniform soil texture. New infiltration and runoff schemes are introduced with a dependency on the soil texture and standard deviation of orography. A set of experiments in stand-alone mode is used to assess the improved prediction of soil moisture at the local scale against field site observations. Comparison with basin-scale water balance (BSWB) and Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) datasets indicates a consistently larger dynamical range of land water mass over large continental areas and an improved prediction of river runoff, while the effect on atmospheric fluxes is fairly small. Finally, the ECMWF data assimilation and prediction systems are used to verify the effect on surface and near-surface quantities in the atmospheric-coupled mode. A midlatitude error reduction is seen both in soil moisture and in 2-m temperature. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The First Institute of Oceanography Earth System Model (FIO-ESM) version 2.0 was developed and participated in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). In comparison with FIO-ESM v1.0, all component models of FIO-ESM v2.0 are updated, and their resolutions are fined. In addition to the non-breaking surface wave-induced mixing (Bv), which has also been included in FIO-ESM v1.0, there are three more distinctive physical processes in FIO-ESM v2.0, including the effect of surface wave Stokes drifts on air–sea momentum and heat fluxes, the effect of wave-induced sea spray on air–sea heat fluxes and the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) diurnal cycle on air–sea heat and gas fluxes. The FIO-ESM v2.0 has conducted the CMIP6 Diagnostic, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima (DECK) and historical experiments. The historical simulation of FIO-ESM v2.0 for 1850–2014 is evaluated, including the surface air temperature (SAT), precipitation, SST, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and so forth. The climate changes with respect to SAT and SST global warming and decreasing AMOC are well reproduced by FIO-ESM v2.0. The correlation coefficient of the global annual mean SAT anomaly can reach 0.92 with observations. In particular, the large warm SST bias at the east coast of tropical Pacific from FIO-ESM v1.0, which is a common challenge for all climate models, is dramatically reduced in FIO-ESM v2.0 and the ENSO period within the range of 2–7 years is well reproduced with the largest variation of SST anomalies occurring in boreal winter, which is consistent with observations.},

abstract = {The Earth's climate is rapidly changing. Over the past centuries, aerosols, via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds, played an important role in counterbalancing some of the greenhouse gas (GHG) caused global warming. The multicentury anthropogenic aerosol cooling effect prevented present-day climate from reaching even higher surface air temperatures and subsequent more dramatic climate impacts. Trends in aerosol concentrations and optical depth show that in many polluted regions such as Europe and the United States, aerosol precursor emissions decreased back to levels of the 1950s. More recent polluting countries such as China may have reached a turning point in recent years as well, while India still follows an upward trend. Here we study aerosol trends in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations of the GISS ModelE2.1 climate model using a fully coupled atmosphere composition configuration, including interactive gas-phase chemistry and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass-based (One-Moment Aerosol, OMA) aerosol module. Results show that whether global aerosol radiative forcing is already declining depends on the aerosol scheme used. Using the aerosol microphysical scheme, where the aerosol system reacts more strongly to the trend in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, global peak direct aerosol forcing was reached in the 1980s, whereas the mass-based scheme simulates peak direct aerosol forcing around 2010.},

abstract = {The latest Hadley Centre climate model, HadGEM2-ES, includes Earth system components such as interactive chemistry and eight species of tropospheric aerosols. It has been run for the period 1860-2100 in support of the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Anthropogenic aerosol emissions peak between 1980 and 2020, resulting in a present-day all-sky top of the atmosphere aerosol forcing of -1.6 and -1.4 W m-2 with and without ammonium nitrate aerosols, respectively, for the sum of direct and first indirect aerosol forcings. Aerosol forcing becomes significantly weaker in the 21st century, being weaker than -0.5 W m-2 in 2100 without nitrate. However, nitrate aerosols become the dominant species in Europe and Asia and decelerate the decrease in global mean aerosol forcing. Considering nitrate aerosols makes aerosol radiative forcing 2-4 times stronger by 2100 depending on the representative concentration pathway, although this impact is lessened when changes in the oxidation properties of the atmosphere are accounted for. Anthropogenic aerosol residence times increase in the future in spite of increased precipitation, as cloud cover and aerosol-cloud interactions decrease in tropical and midlatitude regions. Deposition of fossil fuel black carbon onto snow and ice surfaces peaks during the 20th century in the Arctic and Europe but keeps increasing in the Himalayas until the middle of the 21st century. Results presented here confirm the importance of aerosols in influencing the Earth's climate, albeit with a reduced impact in the future, and suggest that nitrate aerosols will partially replace sulphate aerosols to become an important anthropogenic species in the remainder of the 21st century.

abstract = {A dominant paradigm for mid-latitude air-sea interaction identifies the synoptic-scale atmospheric “noise” as the main driver for the observed ocean surface variability. While this conceptual model successfully holds over most of the mid-latitude ocean surface, its soundness over frontal zones (including western boundary currents; WBC) characterized by intense mesoscale activity, has been questioned in a number of studies suggesting a driving role for the small scale ocean dynamics (mesoscale oceanic eddies) in the modulation of air-sea interaction. In this context, climate models provide a powerful experimental device to inspect the emerging scale-dependent nature of mid-latitude air-sea interaction. This study assesses the impact of model resolution on the representation of air-sea interaction over the Gulf Stream region, in a multi-model ensemble of present-climate simulations performed using a common experimental design. Lead-lag correlation and covariance patterns between sea surface temperature (SST) and turbulent heat flux (THF) are diagnosed to identify the leading regimes of air-sea interaction in a region encompassing both the Gulf Stream system and the North Atlantic subtropical basin. Based on these statistical metrics it is found that coupled models based on “laminar” (eddy-parameterised) and eddy-permitting oceans are able to discriminate between an ocean-driven regime, dominating the region controlled by the Gulf Stream dynamics, and an atmosphere-driven regime, typical of the open ocean regions. However, the increase of model resolution leads to a better representation of SST and THF cross-covariance patterns and functional forms, and the major improvements can be largely ascribed to a refinement of the oceanic model component.},

@article{Beuvier2010,
abstract = {This work is dedicated to the study of the climate variability of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular the study of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) which occurred in the early 1990s. Simulations of the 1961-2000 period have been carried out with an eddy-permitting Ocean General Circulation Model of the Mediterranean Sea, driven by realistic interannual high-resolution air-sea fluxes. Using different databases for the river runoff, Black Sea inflow, and Atlantic thermohaline characteristics at climatological or interannual scales, we assess the effects of the non-atmospheric hydrological forcings on the simulation of the interannual variations of the Mediterranean circulation. The evolution of the basin-scale heat content is in very good agreement with the observations (especially in the surface and intermediate layers), while the agreement is lower for the evolution of the salt content. Convection events in the Aegean Sea are noticed in the simulations between 1972 and 1976, in the late 1980s, and around the EMT period. The formation rates of Cretan Deep Water (CDW) are different during these periods, allowing or preventing the spreading of CDW into the eastern Mediterranean. The sequence of the EMT events is well reproduced: the high winter oceanic surface cooling and net evaporation over the Aegean Sea in the early 1990s, the high amount of dense CDW formed during these winters, and then the overflow and the spreading of this CDW in the eastern Mediterranean. Among the preconditioning processes suggested in the literature, we find that changes in the Levantine surface circulation, possibly induced by the presence in the Cretan Passage of anticyclonic eddies and a lasting period with reduced net precipitation over the eastern Mediterranean, lead to an increase of the salt content of the Aegean Sea. Changes in the Black Sea freshwater inflow or in the characteristic of the Atlantic Water entering at the Gibraltar Strait also modify the thermohaline state of the Aegean Sea before the EMT. But, as none of these preconditioning factors has a lasting impact on lowering the vertical stratification of the Aegean Sea, we conclude that concerning the EMT, the major triggering elements are the atmospheric fluxes and winds occurring in winters 1991-1992 and 1992-1993.

In particular, ACCESS-CM2 is one of Australia's contributions to the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Compared with the ACCESS1.3 model used for our CMIP5 submission, all model components have been upgraded as well as the coupling framework (OASIS3-MCT) and experiment control system (Rose/Cylc). The component models are: UM10.6 GA7.1 for the atmosphere, CABLE2.5 for the land surface, MOM5 for the ocean, and CICE5.1.2 for the sea ice. This paper describes the model configuration of ACCESS-CM2, documents the experimental set up, and assesses the model performance for the preindustrial spin-up simulation in comparison against (reconstructed) observations and ACCESS1.3 results. While the performance of the two generations of the ACCESS coupled model is largely comparable, ACCESS-CM2 shows better global hydrological balance, more realistic ocean water properties (in terms of spatial distribution) and meridional overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean but a poorer simulation of the Antarctic sea ice and a larger energy imbalance at the top of atmosphere. This energy imbalance reflects a noticeable warming trend of the global ocean over the spin-up period.},

@article{Boucher2020,
abstract = {This study presents the global climate model IPSL-CM6A-LR developed at Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) to study natural climate variability and climate response to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). This article describes the different model components, their coupling, and the simulated climate in comparison to previous model versions. We focus here on the representation of the physical climate along with the main characteristics of the global carbon cycle. The model's climatology, as assessed from a range of metrics (related in particular to radiation, temperature, precipitation, and wind), is strongly improved in comparison to previous model versions. Although they are reduced, a number of known biases and shortcomings (e.g., double Intertropical Convergence Zone [ITCZ], frequency of midlatitude wintertime blockings, and El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation [ENSO] dynamics) persist. The equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response have both increased from the previous climate model IPSL-CM5A-LR used in CMIP5. A large ensemble of more than 30 members for the historical period (1850–2018) and a smaller ensemble for a range of emissions scenarios (until 2100 and 2300) are also presented and discussed.},

Here we present a bias correction method that corrects the mean error in the GCM, but retains the six-hourly weather, longer-period climate-variability and climate change from the GCM. We utilize six different bias correction experiments; each correcting different bias components. The impact of the full bias correction and the individual components are examined in relation to tropical cyclones, precipitation and temperature. We show that correcting of all boundary data provides the greatest improvement.},

abstract = {The shallow shelf approximation, a balance of membrane stresses for ice flow, is an effective "sliding law" for ice sheet modeling. Our use of it as a sliding law becomes a standard model for ice stream flow when the sliding velocity is large (1.00 m a-1 and faster). Following Schoof (2006a), we describe the basal resistance as plastic till for which the yield stress is given by a Mohr-Coulomb formula. Pore water pressure is related to basal, melt rate. The velocity field used in the mass continuity and conservation of energy equations is an average of velocities from, the shallow shelf approximation and the nonsliding shallow ice approximation. Using this scheme, our model has realistic, time-dependent ice streams which exhibit the range of surface velocities seen in actual ice streams. We demonstrate the model at high spatial resolution (5 km grid) over multiple millenia using its implementation in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Numerical experiments show that the entire scheme is stable with respect to many parameter changes. Some experiments reveal significant ice stream, variability in a hypothetical, steady climate, with characteristic cycles on the order of 1000 years. We believe this is the first practical whole ice sheet model with a unified treatment of vertical shear stresses and membrane stresses. It is capable of high-resolution, thermomechanically coupled, multimillenia simulations of ice sheets containing ice streams. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The climate sensitivity of global climate models (GCMs) strongly influences projected climate change due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. Reasonably, the climate sensitivity of a GCM may be expected to affect dynamically downscaled projections. However, there has been little examination of the effect of the climate sensitivity of GCMs on regional climate model (RCM) ensembles. Therefore, we present projections of temperature and precipitation from the ensemble of projections produced as a part of the North American branch of the international Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) in the context of their relationship to the climate sensitivity of their parent GCMs. NA-CORDEX simulations were produced at 50-km and 25-km resolutions with multiple RCMs which downscaled multiple GCMs that spanned nearly the full range of climate sensitivity available in the CMIP5 archive. We show that climate sensitivity is a very important source of spread in the NA-CORDEX ensemble, particularly for temperature. Temperature projections correlate with driving GCM climate sensitivity annually and seasonally across North America not only at a continental scale but also at a local-to-regional scale. Importantly, the spread in temperature projections would be reduced if only low, mid, or high climate sensitivity simulations were considered, or if only the ensemble mean were considered. Precipitation projections correlate with climate sensitivity, but only at a continental scale during the cold season, due to the increasing influence of other processes at finer scales. Additionally, it is shown that the RCMs do alter the projection space sampled by their driving GCMs.},

abstract = {This paper documents the biogeochemistry configuration of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), E3SMv1.1-BGC. The model simulates historical carbon cycle dynamics, including carbon losses predicted in response to land use and land cover change, and the responses of the carbon cycle to changes in climate. In addition, we introduce several innovations in the treatment of soil nutrient limitation mechanisms, including explicit dependence on phosphorus availability. The suite of simulations described here includes E3SM contributions to the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project and other projects, as well as simulations to explore the impacts of structural uncertainty in representations of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation. We describe the model spin-up and evaluation procedures, provide an overview of results from the simulation campaign, and highlight key features of the simulations. Cumulative warming over the twentieth century is similar to observations, with a midcentury cold bias offset by stronger warming in recent decades. Ocean biomass production and carbon uptake are underpredicted, likely due to biases in ocean transport leading to widespread anoxia and undersupply of nutrients to surface waters. The inclusion of nutrient limitations in the land biogeochemistry results in weaker carbon fertilization and carbon-climate feedbacks than exhibited by other Earth System Models that exclude those limitations. Finally, we compare with an alternative representation of terrestrial biogeochemistry, which differs in structure and in initialization of soil phosphorus. While both configurations agree well with observational benchmarks, they differ significantly in their distribution of carbon among different pools and in the strength of nutrient limitations.},

abstract = {The Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Earth System Model version 3 (NESM v3) has been developed, aiming to provide a numerical modeling platform for cross-disciplinary Earth system studies, project future Earth climate and environment changes, and conduct subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction. While the previous model version NESM v1 simulates the internal modes of climate variability well, it has no vegetation dynamics and suffers considerable radiative energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and surface, resulting in large biases in the global mean surface air temperature, which limits its utility to simulate past and project future climate changes. The NESM v3 has upgraded atmospheric and land surface model components and improved physical parameterization and conservation of coupling variables. Here we describe the new version's basic features and how the major improvements were made. We demonstrate the v3 model's fidelity and suitability to address global climate variability and change issues. The 500-year preindustrial (PI) experiment shows negligible trends in the net heat flux at the top of atmosphere and the Earth surface. Consistently, the simulated global mean surface air temperature, land surface temperature, and sea surface temperature (SST) are all in a quasi-equilibrium state. The conservation of global water is demonstrated by the stable evolution of the global mean precipitation, sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea water salinity. The sea ice extents (SIEs), as a major indication of high-latitude climate, also maintain a balanced state. The simulated spatial patterns of the energy states, SST, precipitation, and SSS fields are realistic, but the model suffers from a cold bias in the North Atlantic, a warm bias in the Southern Ocean, and associated deficient Antarctic sea ice area, as well as a delicate sign of the double ITCZ syndrome. The estimated radiative forcing of quadrupling carbon dioxide is about 7.24 W m-2, yielding a climate sensitivity feedback parameter of -0.98 W m-2 K-1, and the equilibrium climate sensitivity is 3.69 K. The transient climate response from the 1 {\%} yr-1 CO2 (1pctCO2) increase experiment is 2.16 K. The model's performance on internal modes and responses to external forcing during the historical period will be documented in an accompanying paper.},

A high-resolution configuration of the Community Earth System Model version 1.3 (CESM1.3) is used for the simulations with a nominal horizontal resolution of 0.25° for the atmosphere and land models and 0.1° for the ocean and sea-ice models. At these resolutions, the model permits tropical cyclones and ocean mesoscale eddies, allowing interactions between these synoptic and mesoscale phenomena with large-scale circulations. An overview of the results from these simulations is provided with a focus on model drift, mean climate, internal modes of variability, representation of the historical and future climates, and extreme events. Comparisons are made to solutions from an identical set of simulations using the standard resolution (nominal 1°) CESM1.3 and to available observations for the historical period to address some key scientific questions concerning the impact and benefit of increasing model horizontal resolution in climate simulations. An emerging prominent feature of the high-resolution pre-industrial simulation is the intermittent occurrence of polynyas in the Weddell Sea and its interaction with an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Overall, high-resolution simulations show significant improvements in representing global mean temperature changes, seasonal cycle of sea-surface temperature and mixed layer depth, extreme events and in relationships between extreme events and climate modes.},

abstract = {This paper addresses and documents a number of issues related to the implementation of an advanced land surface-hydrology model in the Penn State-NCAR fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5). The concept adopted here is that the land surface model should be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal variations of surface heat fluxes as surface boundary conditions for coupled models, but also correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the context of a long-term data assimilation system. In a similar way to that in which the modified Oregon State University land surface model (LSM) has been used in the NCEP global and regional forecast models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are introduced in the coupled MM5-LSM system to help identify vegetation/water/soil characteristics at fine scales and capture the feedback of these land surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological 0.15° X 0.15° green vegetation fraction is utilized to represent the annual control of vegetation on the surface evaporation. Specification of various vegetation and soil parameters is discussed, and the available water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the surface layer, especially the calculation of the roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the simulation of surface heat flux. It is shown that the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and the surface energy balance are very sensitive to soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to establish an appropriate soil moisture data assimilation system to improve the soil moisture initialization at fine scales.},

As a first step toward a more comprehensive, process-oriented, validation of the model, this work analyzes a 200-year simulation performed under constant forcing corresponding to present-day climate conditions. In terms of mean climate, the model is able to realistically reproduce the main patterns of temperature, precipitation, and winds. Specifically, we report improvements in the representation of the sea surface temperature with respect to the previous version of the model. In terms of mean atmospheric circulation features, we notice a realistic simulation of upper tropospheric winds and midtroposphere geopotential eddies. The oceanic heat transport and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation satisfactorily compare with present-day observations and estimates from global ocean reanalyses. The sea ice patterns and associated seasonal variations are realistically reproduced in both hemispheres, with a better skill in winter. Main weaknesses of the simulated climate are related with the precipitation patterns, specifically in the tropical regions with large dry biases over the Amazon basin. Similarly, the seasonal precipitation associated with the monsoons, mostly over Asia, is weaker than observed. The main patterns of interannual variability in terms of dominant empirical orthogonal functions are faithfully reproduced, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere winter. In the tropics the main teleconnection patterns associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation and with the Indian Ocean Dipole are also in good agreement with observations.},

abstract = {Four sets of downscaling simulations based on the Eta Regional Climate Model forced by two global climate models, the HadGEM2-ES and the MIROC5, and two RCP scenarios—8.5 and 4.5, have been carried out. The objective of this work is to assess the climate change over South America based on the Eta simulations. The future changes are shown in timeslices of 30 years: 2011-2040; 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. The climate change response of the Eta simulations nested in HadGEM2-ES is larger than the Eta nested in MIROC5. Major warming area is located in the central part of Brazil. In austral summer, the reduction of precipitation in the central part and the increase in the southeastern part of the continent are common changes in these simulations, while the EtaHadGEM2-ES intensifies the decrease of precipitation in central Brazil, the Eta-MIROC5 expands the area of increase of precipitation in southern Brazil toward the end of the century. In austral winter, precipitation decrease is found in the northern part of South America and in most of Central America, whereas the reduction in southeastern South America is limited to near coastal region. The time series of temperatures show that warming trends are larger in the Eta-HadGEM2-ES than in the Eta-MIROC5 simulations. Heavier precipitation rates are projected in the Central-South of Brazil toward the end of the century. Increase in the length of consecutive dry days (CDD) in Northeast of Brazil and the decrease of consecutive wet days (CWD) in the Amazon region are common features in these simulations.},

We work in a perfect-model approach where the LAM is driven by a general circulation model (GCM) run at the same resolution and sharing the same physics and dynamics as the LAM. A set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this issue. Results are consistent with previous studies regarding the seasonal-mean fields.

abstract = {Continental scale marine ice sheets such as the present day West Antarctic Ice Sheet are strongly affected by highly localized features, presenting a challenge to numerical models. Perhaps the best known phenomenon of this kind is the migration of the grounding line - the division between ice in contact with bedrock and floating ice shelves - which needs to be treated at sub-kilometer resolution. We implement a block-structured finite volume method with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for three dimensional ice sheets, which allows us to discretize a narrow region around the grounding line at high resolution and the remainder of the ice sheet at low resolution. We demonstrate AMR simulations that are in agreement with uniform mesh simulations, but are computationally far cheaper, appropriately and efficiently evolving the mesh as the grounding line moves over significant distances. As an example application, we model rapid deglaciation of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica caused by melting beneath its ice shelf. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We use the BISICLES adaptive mesh ice sheet model to carry out one, two, and three century simulations of the fast-flowing ice streams of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, deploying sub-kilometer resolution around the grounding line since coarser resolution results in substantial underestimation of the response. Each of the simulations begins with a geometry and velocity close to present-day observations, and evolves according to variation in meteoric ice accumulation rates and oceanic ice shelf melt rates. Future changes in accumulation and melt rates range from no change, through anomalies computed by atmosphere and ocean models driven by the E1 and A1B emissions scenarios, to spatially uniform melt rate anomalies that remove most of the ice shelves over a few centuries. We find that variation in the resulting ice dynamics is dominated by the choice of initial conditions and ice shelf melt rate and mesh resolution, although ice accumulation affects the net change in volume above flotation to a similar degree. Given sufficient melt rates, we compute grounding line retreat over hundreds of kilometers in every major ice stream, but the ocean models do not predict such melt rates outside of the Amundsen Sea Embayment until after 2100. Within the Amundsen Sea Embayment the largest single source of variability is the onset of sustained retreat in Thwaites Glacier, which can triple the rate of eustatic sea level rise.},

@article{Cuzzone2018,
abstract = {Paleoclimate proxies are being used in conjunction with ice sheet modeling experiments to determine how the Greenland ice sheet responded to past changes, particularly during the last deglaciation. Although these comparisons have been a critical component in our understanding of the Greenland ice sheet sensitivity to past warming, they often rely on modeling experiments that favor minimizing computational expense over increased model physics. Over Paleoclimate timescales, simulating the thermal structure of the ice sheet has large implications on the modeled ice viscosity, which can feedback onto the basal sliding and ice flow. To accurately capture the thermal field, models often require a high number of vertical layers. This is not the case for the stress balance computation, however, where a high vertical resolution is not necessary. Consequently, since stress balance and thermal equations are generally performed on the same mesh, more time is spent on the stress balance computation than is otherwise necessary. For these reasons, running a higher-order ice sheet model (e.g., Blatter-Pattyn) over timescales equivalent to the paleoclimate record has not been possible without incurring a large computational expense. To mitigate this issue, we propose a method that can be implemented within ice sheet models, whereby the vertical interpolation along the z axis relies on higher-order polynomials, rather than the traditional linear interpolation. This method is tested within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) using quadratic and cubic finite elements for the vertical interpolation on an idealized case and a realistic Greenland configuration. A transient experiment for the ice thickness evolution of a single-dome ice sheet demonstrates improved accuracy using the higher-order vertical interpolation compared to models using the linear vertical interpolation, despite having fewer degrees of freedom. This method is also shown to improve a model's ability to capture sharp thermal gradients in an ice sheet particularly close to the bed, when compared to models using a linear vertical interpolation. This is corroborated in a thermal steady-state simulation of the Greenland ice sheet using a higher-order model. In general, we find that using a higher-order vertical interpolation decreases the need for a high number of vertical layers, while dramatically reducing model runtime for transient simulations. Results indicate that when using a higher-order vertical interpolation, runtimes for a transient ice sheet relaxation are upwards of 5 to 7 times faster than using a model which has a linear vertical interpolation, and this thus requires a higher number of vertical layers to achieve a similar result in simulated ice volume, basal temperature, and ice divide thickness. The findings suggest that this method will allow higher-order models to be used in studies investigating ice sheet behavior over paleoclimate timescales at a fraction of the computational cost than would otherwise be needed for a model using a linear vertical interpolation.},

abstract = {An overview of the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) is provided, including a discussion of the challenges encountered during its development and how they were addressed. In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

abstract = {Most climate models do not explicitly model urban areas and at best describe them as rock covers. Nonetheless, the very high resolutions reached now by the regional climate models may justify and require a more realistic parameterization of surface exchanges between urban canopy and atmosphere. To quantify the potential impact of urbanization on the regional climate, and evaluate the benefits of a detailed urban canopy model compared with a simpler approach, a sensitivity study was carried out over France at a 12-km horizontal resolution with the ALADIN-Climate regional model for 1980–2009 time period. Different descriptions of land use and urban modeling were compared, corresponding to an explicit modeling of cities with the urban canopy model TEB, a conventional and simpler approach representing urban areas as rocks, and a vegetated experiment for which cities are replaced by natural covers. A general evaluation of ALADIN-Climate was first done, that showed an overestimation of the incoming solar radiation but satisfying results in terms of precipitation and near-surface temperatures. The sensitivity analysis then highlighted that urban areas had a significant impact on modeled near-surface temperature. A further analysis on a few large French cities indicated that over the 30 years of simulation they all induced a warming effect both at daytime and nighttime with values up to + 1.5 °C for the city of Paris. The urban model also led to a regional warming extending beyond the urban areas boundaries. Finally, the comparison to temperature observations available for Paris area highlighted that the detailed urban canopy model improved the modeling of the urban heat island compared with a simpler approach.},

abstract = {Relative sea-level variations during the late Pleistocene can only be reconstructed with the knowledge of ice-sheet history. On the other hand, the knowledge of regional and global relative sea-level variations is necessary to learn about the changes in ice volume. Overcoming this problem of circularity demands a fully coupled system where ice sheets and sea level vary consistently in space and time and dynamically affect each other. Here we present results for the past 410 000 years (410 kyr) from the coupling of a set of 3-D ice-sheet-shelf models to a global sea-level model, which is based on the solution of the gravitationally self-consistent sea-level equation. The sea-level model incorporates the glacial isostatic adjustment feedbacks for a Maxwell viscoelastic and rotating Earth model with coastal migration. Ice volume is computed with four 3-D ice-sheet-shelf models for North America, Eurasia, Greenland and Antarctica. Using an inverse approach, ice volume and temperature are derived from a benthic $\delta$18O stacked record. The derived surface-air temperature anomaly is added to the present-day climatology to simulate glacial-interglacial changes in temperature and hence ice volume. The ice-sheet thickness variations are then forwarded to the sea-level model to compute the bedrock deformation, the change in sea-surface height and thus the relative sea-level change. The latter is then forwarded to the ice-sheet models. To quantify the impact of relative sea-level variations on ice-volume evolution, we have performed coupled and uncoupled simulations. The largest differences of ice-sheet thickness change occur at the edges of the ice sheets, where relative sea-level change significantly departs from the ocean-averaged sea-level variations.},

abstract = {A model that computes the fluxes of energy and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere is presented. It is designed to serve as a lower boundary in a mesoscale atmospheric model and is intended to be used to study the influence of the land surface on regional atmospheric circulations and climate. The land surface model contains one vegetation layer, a soil skin layer, and four subsurface soil layers. The shortwave and longwave radiation schemes are based on the two-stream theory. Turbulent transfer is treated in a very simple manner, by considering canopy-air and ground-air exchanges separately. Plant water flow is governed by differences in water potential between the soil and the leaves. The stomatal resistance formulation uses the effective leaf area index and the leaf water potential as key variables. It is shown that the resulting transpiration scheme implicitly accounts for the influence of visible radiation, soil moisture, atmospheric saturation deficit, and leaf temperature. The results of four validation experiments are shown. Parameters were chosen prior to the model runs, and no tuning was involved. These experiments show that the surface model is capable of reproducing observed fluxes within instrumental error including timescales ranging from rapid weather changes up to several months.},

abstract = {In the companion paper to this one (Part I), the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere-Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (ISBA-TRIP) continental hydrological system of the Centre National de Recherches M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologiques is evaluated by using river discharge measurements and terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations derived from three independent datasets of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). One of the conclusions is that the river reservoir simulated by TRIP at the global scale seems to be one of the main sources of TWS and/or discharge errors. Here, the authors study these uncertainties in river routing processes, such as flow velocity and groundwater storage. For this purpose, a simple groundwater reservoir depending on a time delay factor and a variable streamflow velocity calculated via Manning's formula are added to TRIP following the approach of Arora and Boer. The previous and the new TRIP are then compared, and two studies of the sensitivity to the groundwater time delay factor and to the flow velocity are performed. Using the same experiment design as in Part I, the authors show that the effect of this flow velocity and of the groundwater time delay factor on the ISBA-TRIP simulation is potentially significant. Nevertheless, over tropical and temperate basins, a competition between the two processes implies a slight difference between the previous and the new TRIP compared to both the GRACE and the discharge signals. The global results underline that simulating a realistic streamflow velocity is a key process for global-scale application. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {In recent years, significant efforts have been made to upgrade physical processes in the ISBA-CTRIP land surface system for use in fully coupled climate studies using the new CNRM-CM6 climate model or in stand-alone mode for global hydrological applications. Here we provide a thorough description of the new and improved processes implemented between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 versions of the model and evaluate the hydrology and thermal behavior of the model at the global scale. The soil scheme explicitly solves the one-dimensional Fourier and Darcy laws throughout the soil, accounting for the dependency of hydraulic and thermal soil properties on soil organic carbon content. The snowpack is represented using a multilayer detailed internal-process snow scheme. A two-way dynamic flood scheme is added in which floodplains interact with the soil hydrology through reinfiltration of floodwater and with the overlying atmosphere through surface free-water evaporation. Finally, groundwater processes are represented via a two-dimensional diffusive unconfined aquifer scheme allowing upward capillarity rises into the superficial soil. This new system has been evaluated in off-line mode using two different atmospheric forcings and against a large set of satellite estimates and in situ observations. While this study is not without weaknesses, its results show a real advance in modeling the physical aspects of the land surface with the new ISBA-CTRIP version compared to the previous system. This increases our confidence that the model is able to represent the land surface physical processes accurately across the globe and in turn contribute to several important scientific and societal issues.},

abstract = {We present the latest version of the ISBA-CTRIP land surface system, focusing on the representation of the land carbon cycle. We review the main improvements since the year 2012, mainly added modules for wild fires, carbon leaching through soil and transport of dissolved organic carbon to the ocean, and land cover changes but also improved representation of photosynthesis, respiration, and plant functional types. This version of ISBA-CTRIP is fully described in terms of land carbon pools, fluxes, and their interactions. Results are compared with the previous version in an off-line mode forced by observed climate during the historical time period. The two simulations are presented to demonstrate the model performance compared to an ensemble of observed and observation-derived data sets for gross and net primary productivity, heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration, above and below ground biomass, litter, and soil carbon pools. New developments specific to the new version such as burned area, fire emissions, carbon leaching, and land cover are also validated against observations. The results show clearly that the latest version of ISBA-CTRIP outperforms the former version and reproduces generally well the observed mean spatial patterns in carbon pools and fluxes, as well as the seasonal cycle of leaf area index. The trends of the global fluxes over the last 50 years agree with other global models and with available estimates. This comparison gives us confidence that the model represents the main processes involved in the terrestrial carbon cycle and can be used to explore future global change projections.},

abstract = {A review is presented of the development and simulation characteristics of the most recent version of a global coupled model for climate variability and change studies at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, as well as a review of the climate change experiments performed with the model. The atmospheric portion of the coupled model uses a spectral technique with rhomboidal 30 truncation, which corresponds to a transform grid with a resolution of approximately 3.75° longitude by 2.25° latitude. The ocean component has a resolution of approximately 1.875° longitude by 2.25° latitude. Relatively simple formulations of river routing, sea ice, and land surface processes are included. Two primary versions of the coupled model are described, differing in their initialization techniques and in the specification of sub-grid scale oceanic mixing of heat and salt. For each model a stable control integration of near millennial scale duration has been conducted, and the characteristics of both the time-mean and variability are described and compared to observations. A review is presented of a suite of climate change experiments conducted with these models using both idealized and realistic estimates of time-varying radiative forcing. Some experiments include estimates of forcing from past changes in volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance. The experiments performed are described, and some of the central findings are highlighted. In particular, the observed increase in global mean surface temperature is largely contained within the spread of simulated global mean temperatures from an ensemble of experiments using observationally-derived estimates of the changes in radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols.},

abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional chemistry-climate model (CCM) called the "Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Chemistry-Climate Model, version 2" (MRI-CCM2). The model treats chemical and physical processes interactively from the surface to the stratosphere to simulate the global distribution and evolution of ozone and other trace gases with a framework similar to that of version 1 (MRI-CCM1), which was a stratospheric model. We have added detailed tropospheric chemistry to Version 1 in order to seamlessly treat ozone chemistry in both the troposphere and stratosphere. The chemistry module of Version 2 includes 90 chemical species with 172 gas-phase reactions, 59 photolysis reactions and 16 heterogeneous reactions; includes improved grid-scale transport with a semi-Lagrangian scheme, sub grid-scale convective transportand turbulent diffusion, dry and wet deposition, and emissions of trace gases from various sources. We conducted a free run and an assimilated run towards observed atmospheric fields over 11 years, to reproduce the 1990s distribution of chemical constituents. The simulated seasonal cycle and geographical distribution of ozone below the middle troposphere are generally in good agreement with ozonesonde observations, although ozone was underestimated in the lower troposphere in the south polar region, and extratropical ozone was overestimated in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Version 2 also reproduces realistic characteristics for other species such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and the hydroxyl radical (OH): The model reproduces the observed seasonal cycle of CO well, although it overestimates CO by about 15 ppbv in the southern high latitudes; the vertical profiles of NO captures the observed features; and finally, distribution of the OH radical is similar to that simulated by other recent CCMs. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Japan Meteorological Agency / Meteorological Research Institute.},

abstract = {The ability of regional climate models (RCMs) to accurately simulate current and future climate is increasingly important for impact assessment. This is the first evaluation of all reanalysis-driven RCMs within the CORDEX Australasia framework [four configurations of the Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) model, and single configurations of COSMO-CLM (CCLM) and the Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM)] to simulate the historical climate of Australia (1981–2010) at 50 km resolution. Simulations of near-surface maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were compared with gridded observations at annual, seasonal, and daily time scales. The spatial extent, sign, and statistical significance of biases varied markedly between the RCMs. However, all RCMs showed widespread, statistically significant cold biases in maximum temperature which were the largest during winter. This bias exceeded − 5 K for some WRF configurations, and was the lowest for CCLM at ± 2 K. Most WRF configurations and CCAM simulated minimum temperatures more accurately than maximum temperatures, with biases in the range of ± 1.5 K. RCMs overestimated precipitation, especially over Australia's populous eastern seaboard. Strong negative correlations between mean monthly biases in precipitation and maximum temperature suggest that the maximum temperature cold bias is linked to precipitation overestimation. This analysis shows that the CORDEX Australasia ensemble is a valuable dataset for future impact studies, but improving the representation of land surface processes, and subsequently of surface temperatures, will improve RCM performance. The varying RCM capabilities identified here serve as a foundation for the development of future regional climate projections and impact assessments for Australia.},

abstract = {Several multidecadal simulations have been carried out with the new version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). This paper reports an analysis of the land component of these simulations. Global annual averages over land appear to be within the uncertainty of observational datasets, but the seasonal cycle over land of temperature and precipitation appears to be too weak. These departures from observations appear to be primarily a consequence of deficiencies in the simulation of the atmospheric model rather than of the land processes. High latitudes of northern winter are biased sufficiently warm to have a significant impact on the simulated value of global land temperature. The precipitation is approximately doubled from what it should be at some locations, and the snowpack and spring runoff are also excessive. The winter precipitation over Tibet is larger than observed. About two-thirds of this precipitation is sublimated during the winter, but what remains still produces a snowpack that is very large compared to that observed with correspondingly excessive spring runoff. A large cold anomaly over the Sahara Desert and Sahel also appears to be a consequence of a large anomaly in downward longwave radiation; low column water vapor appears to be most responsible. The modeled precipitation over the Amazon basin is low compared to that observed, the soil becomes too dry, and the temperature is too warm during the dry season. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Verification of the EBU-POM regional atmosphere-ocean coupled model (RAOCM) was carried out using satellite observations of SST and surface winds over the Adriatic Sea. The atmospheric component has a horizontal resolution of 0.125 degree (approximately 10 km) and 32 vertical levels, while the ocean component has a horizontal resolution of approximately 4 km with 21 sigma vertical levels. Verification of the forecasted SST was performed for 15 forecasts during 2006, each of them seven days long. These forecasts coincide with the operating cycle of the Adriatic Regional Model (AREG), which provided the initial fields and boundary conditions for the ocean component of EBU-POM. Two sources of data were used for the initial and boundary conditions of the atmosphere: primary data were obtained from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), while data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were used to test the sensitivity to boundary conditions. Forecast skill was expressed in terms of BIAS and root mean square error (RMSE). During most the of verification period, the model had a negative BIAS of approximately {\&}minus;0.3°, while RMSE varied between 1.1° and 1.2°. Interestingly, these errors did not increase over time, which means that the forecast skill did not decline during the integrations. The 10-m wind verification was conducted for one period of 17 days in February 2007, during a strong bora episode, for which satellite estimates of surface winds were available. During the same period, SST measurements were conducted twice a day, which enabled us to verify diurnal variations of SST simulated by the RAOCM model. Since ECMWF's deterministic forecasts do not cover such a long period, we decided to use the ECMWF analysis, i.e. we ran the model in hindcast mode. The winds simulated in this analysis were weaker than the satellite estimates, with a mean BIAS of {\&}minus;0.8 m/s.},

abstract = {The rising atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation is likely to provoke significant climate perturbations, while having far-reaching consequences for the terrestrial biosphere. Some plants could maintain the same intake of CO2 for photosynthesis by reducing their stomatal openings, thus limiting the transpiration and providing a positive feedback to the projected surface warming. Other plants could benefit from the higher CO2 level and the warmer climate to increase their productivity, which would on the contrary promote the transpiration. The relevance of these feedbacks has been investigated with the M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}-France atmospheric general circulation model. The model has been run at the T31 spectral truncation with 19 vertical levels and is forced with sea surface temperature and sea ice anomalies provided by a transient simulation performed with the Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere model. Besides a reference doubled-CO2 experiment with no modification of the vegetation properties, two other experiments have been performed to explore the impact of changes in the physiology (stomatal resistance) and structure (leaf area index) of plants. Globally and annually averaged, the radiative impact of the CO2 doubling leads to a 2°C surface warming and a 6{\%} precipitation increase, in keeping with previous similar experiments. The vegetation feedbacks do not greatly modify the model response on the global scale. The increase in stomatal resistance does not systematically lead to higher near-surface temperatures due to changes in the soil wetness annual cycle and the atmospheric circulation. However, both physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks are evident on the regional scale. They are liable to modify the CO2 impact on the hydrological cycle, as illustrated for the case of the European summertime climate and the Asian summer monsoon. The strong sensitivity of the climate in these areas emphasizes the large uncertainties of climate change predictions for some of the most populated regions of the world and argues for the need to include more interactive land surface processes in current generation climate models.

abstract = {Simulation of coupled carbon-climate requires representation of ocean carbon cycling, but the computational burden of simulating the dozens of prognostic tracers in state-of-the-art biogeochemistry ecosystem models can be prohibitive. We describe a six-tracer biogeochemistry module of steady-state phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in Biogeochemistry with Light, Iron, Nutrients and Gas (BLING version 2) with particular emphasis on enhancements relative to the previous version and evaluate its implementation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's (GFDL) fourth-generation climate model (CM4.0) with ¼° ocean. Major geographical and vertical patterns in chlorophyll, phosphorus, alkalinity, inorganic and organic carbon, and oxygen are well represented. Major biases in BLINGv2 include overly intensified production in high-productivity regions at the expense of productivity in the oligotrophic oceans, overly zonal structure in tropical phosphorus, and intensified hypoxia in the eastern ocean basins as is typical in climate models. Overall, while BLINGv2 structural limitations prevent sophisticated application to plankton physiology, ecology, or biodiversity, its ability to represent major organic, inorganic, and solubility pumps makes it suitable for many coupled carbon-climate and biogeochemistry studies including eddy interactions in the ocean interior. We further overview the biogeochemistry and circulation mechanisms that shape carbon uptake over the historical period. As an initial analysis of model historical and idealized response, we show that CM4.0 takes up slightly more anthropogenic carbon than previous models in part due to enhanced ventilation in the absence of an eddy parameterization. The CM4.0 biogeochemistry response to CO2 doubling highlights a mix of large declines and moderate increases consistent with previous models.},

In contrast with GFDL's CM4.0 development effort that focuses on ocean resolution for physical climate, ESM4.1 focuses on comprehensiveness of Earth system interactions. ESM4.1 features doubled horizontal resolution of both atmosphere (2° to 1°) and ocean (1° to 0.5°) relative to GFDL's previous-generation coupled ESM2-carbon and CM3-chemistry models. ESM4.1 brings together key representational advances in CM4.0 dynamics and physics along with those in aerosols and their precursor emissions, land ecosystem vegetation and canopy competition, and multiday fire; ocean ecological and biogeochemical interactions, comprehensive land-atmosphere-ocean cycling of CO2, dust and iron, and interactive ocean-atmosphere nitrogen cycling are described in detail across this volume of JAMES and presented here in terms of the overall coupling and resulting fidelity. ESM4.1 provides much improved fidelity in CO2 and chemistry over ESM2 and CM3, captures most of CM4.0's baseline simulations characteristics, and notably improves on CM4.0 in (1) Southern Ocean mode and intermediate water ventilation, (2) Southern Ocean aerosols, and (3) reduced spurious ocean heat uptake. ESM4.1 has reduced transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity compared to CM4.0. Fidelity concerns include (1) moderate degradation in sea surface temperature biases, (2) degradation in aerosols in some regions, and (3) strong centennial scale climate modulation by Southern Ocean convection.},

abstract = {We present the impact tests that preceded the most recent operational upgrades to the land surface model used in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) mesoscale Eta model, whose operational domain includes North America. These improvements consist of changes to the "Noah" land surface model (LSM) physics, most notable in the area of cold season processes. Results indicate improved performance in forecasting low-level temperature and humidity, with improvements to (or without affecting) the overall performance of the Eta model quantitative precipitation scores and upper air verification statistics. Remaining issues that directly affect the Noah LSM performance in the Eta model include physical parameterizations of radiation and clouds, which affect the amount of available energy at the surface, and stable boundary layer and surface layer processes, which affect surface turbulent heat fluxes and ultimately the surface energy budget.

abstract = {The Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) includes a detailed representation of chemistry throughout the atmosphere in the Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry and Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model configurations. These model configurations use the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART) family of chemical mechanisms, covering the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere. The new MOZART tropospheric chemistry scheme (T1) has a number of updates over the previous version (MOZART-4) in CESM, including improvements to the oxidation of isoprene and terpenes, organic nitrate speciation, and aromatic speciation and oxidation and thus improved representation of ozone and secondary organic aerosol precursors. An evaluation of the present-day simulations of CESM2 being provided for Climate Model Intercomparison Project round 6 (CMIP6) is presented. These simulations, using the anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions from the inventories specified for CMIP6, as well as online calculation of emissions of biogenic compounds, lightning NO, dust, and sea salt, indicate an underestimate of anthropogenic emissions of a variety of compounds, including carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. The simulation of surface ozone in the southeast United States is improved over previous model versions, largely due to the improved representation of reactive nitrogen and organic nitrate compounds resulting in a lower ozone production rate than in CESM1 but still overestimates observations in summer. The simulation of tropospheric ozone agrees well with ozonesonde observations in many parts of the globe. The comparison of NOx and PAN to aircraft observations indicates the model simulates the nitrogen budget well.},

abstract = {A simulation of 51 years (1957-2008) has been performed over Greenland using the regional atmospheric climate model (RACMO2/GR) at a horizontal grid spacing of 11 km and forced by ECMWF re-analysis products. To better represent processes affecting ice sheet surface mass balance, such as meltwater refreezing and penetration, an additional snow/ice surface module has been developed and implemented into the surface part of the climate model. The temporal evolution and climatology of the model is evaluated with in situ coastal and ice sheet atmospheric measurements of near-surface variables and surface energy balance components. The bias for the near-surface air temperature (-0.8 °C), specific humidity (0.1 g kg-1), wind speed (0.3 m s-1) as well as for radiative (2.5 W m-2 for net radiation) and turbulent heat fluxes shows that the model is in good accordance with available observations on and around the ice sheet. The modelled surface energy budget underestimates the downward longwave radiation and overestimates the sensible heat flux. Due to their compensating effect, the averaged 2 m temperature bias is small and the katabatic wind circulation well captured by the model. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {A new regional climate projection ensemble has been created for the Australasia region as part of the World Climate Research Programs Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The CORDEX-Australasia ensemble is the largest regional climate projection ensemble ever created for the region. It is a 20-member ensemble made by 6 regional climate models downscaling 11 global climate models. Overall the ensemble produces a good representation of recent climate. Consistent biases within the ensemble include an underestimation of the diurnal temperature range and an underestimation of precipitation across much of southern Australia. Under a high emissions scenario projected temperature changes by the end of the twenty-first century reach {\~{}} 5 K in the interior of Australia with smaller increases found toward the coast. Projected precipitation changes are towards drying, particularly in the most populated areas of the southwest and southeast of the continent. The projected precipitation change is very seasonal with summer projected to see little change leaning toward an increase. These results provide a foundation enabling future studies of regional climate changes, climate change impacts, and adaptation options for Australia.},

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850-near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: How does the Earth system respond to forcing What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

abstract = {Emission, transport, chemistry and rainout of the sulfur species DMS, SO2 and sulfate are calculated on-line with the meteorology in a global atmospheric circulation model. The model simulates the main components of the hydrological cycle, including the liquid water content of clouds, and hence it allows an explicit treatment of cloud transformation processes and precipitation scavenging. The importance of the different oxidation pathways of DMS and SO2 is estimated. About 2/3 of the sulfate is produced within clouds, with H2O2 being the most efficient pathway (59{\%}) and with a minor contribution due to oxidation with O3 (7{\%}). Predicted atmospheric surface concentrations of SO2 and sulfate and the deposition fluxes are compared with the observations. Over most parts of the globe the agreement between simulated and observed annual averages is within a factor of 2. A significant underestimate of the simulated sulfate concentrations was found in high latitudes in winter. This bias may be attributed to a too slow oxidation in clouds. The calculated global mean turn-over times for DMS (2.2 d), SO2 (1.6 d) and sulfate (4.4 d) are within the range of previous estimates.},

abstract = {We present the first forcing interpretation of the future anthropogenic aerosol scenarios of CMIP6 with the simple plumes parameterisation MACv2-SP. The nine scenarios for 2015 to 2100 are based on anthropogenic aerosol emissions for use in CMIP6 (Riahi et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2018). We use the emissions to scale the observationally informed anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and the associated effect on the cloud albedo of present-day (Fiedler et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2017) into the future. The resulting scenarios in MACv2-SP are then ranked according to their strength in forcing magnitude and spatial asymmetries for anthropogenic aerosol. All scenarios, except SSP3-70 and SSP4-60, show a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol by 2100 with a range from 108{\%} to 36{\%} of the anthropogenic aerosol optical depth in 2015. We estimate the radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosol from high- A nd lowend scenarios in the mid-2090s by performing ensembles of simulations with the atmosphere-only configuration of MPIESM1.2. MACv2-SP translates the CMIP6 emission scenarios for inducing anthropogenic aerosol forcing. With the implementation in our model, we obtain forcing estimates for both the shortwave instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) and the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of anthropogenic aerosol relative to 1850. Here, ERF accounts for rapid atmospheric adjustments and natural variability internal to the model. The ERF of anthropogenic aerosol for the mid-2090s ranges from-0.15Wm-2 for SSP1-19 to-0.54Wm-2 for SSP3-70, i.e. the mid-2090s ERF is 30 {\%}-108{\%} of the value in the mid-2000s due to differences in the emission pathway alone. Assuming a stronger Twomey effect changes these ERFs to-0.39 and-0.92Wm-2, respectively, which are similar to estimates obtained from models with complex aerosol parameterisations. The year-to-year standard deviations around 0.3Wm-2 associated with natural variability highlight the necessity to average over sufficiently long time periods for estimating ERF; this is in contrast to RF that is typically well constrained after simulating just 1 year. The scenario interpretation of MACv2-SP will be used within the framework of CMIP6 and other cutting-edge scientific endeavours.},

abstract = {Continuing global warming will have a strong impact on the Greenland ice sheet in the coming centuries. During the last decade (2000-2010), both increased melt-water runoff and enhanced ice discharge from calving glaciers have contributed 0.6 ± 0.1 mm yr-1 to global sea-level rise, with a relative contribution of 60 and 40{\%} respectively. Here we use a higher-order ice flow model, spun up to present day, to simulate future ice volume changes driven by both atmospheric and oceanic temperature changes. For these projections, the flow model accounts for runoff-induced basal lubrication and ocean warming-induced discharge increase at the marine margins. For a suite of 10 atmosphere and ocean general circulation models and four representative concentration pathway scenarios, the projected sea-level rise between 2000 and 2100 lies in the range of +1.4 to +16.6 cm. For two low emission scenarios, the projections are conducted up to 2300. Ice loss rates are found to abate for the most favourable scenario where the warming peaks in this century, allowing the ice sheet to maintain a geometry close to the present-day state. For the other moderate scenario, loss rates remain at a constant level over 300 years. In any scenario, volume loss is predominantly caused by increased surface melting as the contribution from enhanced ice discharge decreases over time and is self-limited by thinning and retreat of the marine margin, reducing the ice-ocean contact area. As confirmed by other studies, we find that the effect of enhanced basal lubrication on the volume evolution is negligible on centennial timescales. Our projections show that the observed rates of volume change over the last decades cannot simply be extrapolated over the 21st century on account of a different balance of processes causing ice loss over time. Our results also indicate that the largest source of uncertainty arises from the surface mass balance and the underlying climate change projections, not from ice dynamics.},

The simulations shown here are two dimensional and cover the July 5-24, 1991, period, a typical fine weather period in that area. The synoptic scale wind, temperature, and humidity evolution are included. Simulated wind and temperature compare reasonably well with available observations. The simulated snow/ice melting is examined, and the sensitivity of the model to the ice-sheet surface representation is discussed by replacing the snow/ice model by a classical force-restore model. It is found that the melting-refreezing of liquid water in the snow pack impacts significantly the surface energy and mass balances of the ice sheet. In particular, the nighttime surface temperature minimum and katabatic wind speed are less marked when the refreezing process is activated in the model.

The snow model is verified for the French Alps by comparing its simulations to observations performed at the Col de Porte in the Chartreuse Massif. The snow erosion threshold depends on snow-pack properties such as density, dendricity, sphericity and particle size. The atmospheric turbulence scheme is modified in order to take into account stabilization effects due to airborne blown snow particles. In particular, vertically integrated stability functions for the stable boundary layer are completed by including the threshold friction velocity for snow erosion. The snow-drift model is calibrated by simulating the conditions observed during the Byrd snow project, held in West Antarctica in 1962. Finally, sensitivity experiments to the snow-surface properties show the importance of their accurate representation when modelling the contribution of deflation to the Antarctic surface mass balance.},

@article{Gillet-Chaulet2012,
abstract = {Over the last two decades, the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has been losing mass at an increasing rate, enhancing its contribution to sea-level rise (SLR). The recent increases in ice loss appear to be due to changes in both the surface mass balance of the ice sheet and ice discharge (ice flux to the ocean). Rapid ice flow directly affects the discharge, but also alters ice-sheet geometry and so affects climate and surface mass balance. Present-day ice-sheet models only represent rapid ice flow in an approximate fashion and, as a consequence, have never explicitly addressed the role of ice discharge on the total GrIS mass balance, especially at the scale of individual outlet glaciers. Here, we present a new-generation prognostic ice-sheet model which reproduces the current patterns of rapid ice flow. This requires three essential developments: the complete solution of the full system of equations governing ice deformation; a variable resolution unstructured mesh to resolve outlet glaciers and the use of inverse methods to better constrain poorly known parameters using observations. The modelled ice discharge is in good agreement with observations on the continental scale and for individual outlets. From this initial state, we investigate possible bounds for the next century ice-sheet mass loss. We run sensitivity experiments of the GrIS dynamical response to perturbations in climate and basal lubrication, assuming a fixed position of the marine termini. We find that increasing ablation tends to reduce outflow and thus decreases the ice-sheet imbalance. In our experiments, the GrIS initial mass (im)balance is preserved throughout the whole century in the absence of reinforced forcing, allowing us to estimate a lower bound of 75 mm for the GrIS contribution to SLR by 2100. In one experiment, we show that the current increase in the rate of ice loss can be reproduced and maintained throughout the whole century. However, this requires a very unlikely perturbation of basal lubrication. From this result we are able to estimate an upper bound of 140 mm from dynamics only for the GrIS contribution to SLR by 2100. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {In ice-sheet models, slip conditions at the base between the ice and the bed are parameterized by a friction law. The most common relation has two poorly constrained parameters, C and m. The basal slipperiness coefficient, C, depends on local unobserved quantities and is routinely inferred using inverse methods. While model results have shown that transient responses to external forcing are highly sensitive to the stress exponent m, no consensus value has emerged, with values commonly used ranging from 1 to ∞ depending on the slip processes. By assimilation of Pine Island Glacier surface velocities from 1996 to 2010, we show that observed accelerations are best reproduced with m≥5. We conclude that basal motion, in much of the fast flowing region, is governed by plastic deformation of the underlying sediments. This implies that the glacier bed in this area cannot deliver resistive stresses higher than today, making the drainage basin potentially more sensitive to dynamical perturbations than predicted with models using standard values m = 1 or 3.},

Of special interest within this ensemble is the ARPEGE model by the Centre National de Recherches M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologiques (CNRM), which shares a large amount of core code with ALARO-0. Results show that ALARO-0 is capable of representing the European climate in an acceptable way as most of the ALARO-0 scores lie within the existing ensemble. However, for near-surface air temperature, some large biases, which are often also found in the ARPEGE results, persist. For precipitation, on the other hand, the ALARO-0 model produces some of the best scores within the ensemble and no clear resemblance to ARPEGE is found, which is attributed to the inclusion of 3MT. Additionally, a jackknife procedure is applied to the ALARO-0 results in order to test whether the scores are robust, meaning independent of the period used to calculate them. Periods of 20 years are sampled from the 32-year simulation and used to construct the 95 {\%} confidence interval for each score. For most scores, these intervals are very small compared to the total ensemble spread, implying that model differences in the scores are significant.},

abstract = {Earlier large-scale Greenland ice sheet sea-level projections (e.g. those run during the ice2sea and SeaRISE initiatives) have shown that ice sheet initial conditions have a large effect on the projections and give rise to important uncertainties. The goal of this initMIP-Greenland intercomparison exercise is to compare, evaluate, and improve the initialisation techniques used in the ice sheet modelling community and to estimate the associated uncertainties in modelled mass changes. initMIP-Greenland is the first in a series of ice sheet model intercomparison activities within ISMIP6 (the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6), which is the primary activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) focusing on the ice sheets. Two experiments for the large-scale Greenland ice sheet have been designed to allow intercomparison between participating models of (1) the initial present-day state of the ice sheet and (2) the response in two idealised forward experiments. The forward experiments serve to evaluate the initialisation in terms of model drift (forward run without additional forcing) and in response to a large perturbation (prescribed surface mass balance anomaly); they should not be interpreted as sea-level projections. We present and discuss results that highlight the diversity of data sets, boundary conditions, and initialisation techniques used in the community to generate initial states of the Greenland ice sheet. We find good agreement across the ensemble for the dynamic response to surface mass balance changes in areas where the simulated ice sheets overlap but differences arising from the initial size of the ice sheet. The model drift in the control experiment is reduced for models that participated in earlier intercomparison exercises.},

abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global mean sea-level rise today and is expected to continue to lose mass as the Arctic continues to warm. The two predominant mass loss mechanisms are increased surface meltwater run-off and mass loss associated with the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by output from a representative subset of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The simulations are part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6).We estimate the sea-level contribution together with uncertainties due to future climate forcing, ice sheet model formulations and ocean forcing for the two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. The results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass in both scenarios until 2100, with contributions of 90-50 and 32-17mm to sea-level rise for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The largest mass loss is expected from the south-west of Greenland, which is governed by surface mass balance changes, continuing what is already observed today. Because the contributions are calculated against an unforced control experiment, these numbers do not include any committed mass loss, i.e. mass loss that would occur over the coming century if the climate forcing remained constant. Under RCP8.5 forcing, ice sheet model uncertainty explains an ensemble spread of 40 mm, while climate model uncertainty and ocean forcing uncertainty account for a spread of 36 and 19 mm, respectively. Apart from those formally derived uncertainty ranges, the largest gap in our knowledge is about the physical understanding and implementation of the calving process, i.e. the interaction of the ice sheet with the ocean.},

abstract = {This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

abstract = {Government policies currently commit us to surface warming of three to four degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which will lead to enhanced ice-sheet melt. Ice-sheet discharge was not explicitly included in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, so effects on climate from this melt are not currently captured in the simulations most commonly used to inform governmental policy. Here we show, using simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets constrained by satellite-based measurements of recent changes in ice mass, that increasing meltwater from Greenland will lead to substantial slowing of the Atlantic overturning circulation, and that meltwater from Antarctica will trap warm water below the sea surface, creating a positive feedback that increases Antarctic ice loss. In our simulations, future ice-sheet melt enhances global temperature variability and contributes up to 25 centimetres to sea level by 2100. However, uncertainties in the way in which future changes in ice dynamics are modelled remain, underlining the need for continued observations and comprehensive multi-model assessments.},

abstract = {In order to model the thermal structure of polythermal ice sheets accurately, energy-conserving schemes and correct tracking of the cold-temperate transition surface (CTS) are necessary. We compare four different thermodynamics solvers in the ice sheet model SICOPOLIS. Two exist already, namely a two-layer polythermal scheme (POLY) and a single-phase cold-ice scheme (COLD), while the other two are newly-implemented, one-layer enthalpy schemes, namely a conventional scheme (ENTC) and a melting-CTS scheme (ENTM). The comparison uses scenarios of the EISMINT Phase 2 Simplified Geometry Experiments (Payne et al., 2000, J. Glaciol. 46, 227-238). The POLY scheme is used as a reference against which the performance of the other schemes is tested. Both the COLD scheme and the ENTC scheme fail to produce a continuous temperature gradient across the CTS, which is explicitly enforced by the ENTM scheme. ENTM is more precise than ENTC for determining the position of the CTS, while the performance of both schemes is good for the temperature/water-content profiles in the entire ice column. Therefore, the one-layer enthalpy schemes ENTC and ENTM are viable, easier implementable alternatives to the POLY scheme with its need to handle two different numerical domains for cold and temperate ice.},

Now nonspecialists such as government officials, policy makers, and the general public all have an increasing need to access climate model output and understand its implications. For this host of users, accurate and complete metadata (i.e., information about how and why the data were produced) is required to document the climate modeling results. Here we describe a pilot community initiative to collect and make available documentation of climate models and their simulations. In an initial application, a metadata repository is being established to provide information of this kind for a major internationally coordinated modeling activity known as CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5). It is expected that for a wide range of stakeholders, this and similar community-managed metadata repositories will spur development of analysis tools that facilitate discovery and exploitation of Earth system simulations.},

abstract = {A new computationally efficient version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) is presented. This new version (here termed NorESM1-F) runs about 2.5 times faster (e.g., 90 model years per day on current hardware) than the version that contributed to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison project (CMIP5), i.e., NorESM1-M, and is therefore particularly suitable for multimillennial paleoclimate and carbon cycle simulations or large ensemble simulations. The speed-up is primarily a result of using a prescribed atmosphere aerosol chemistry and a tripolar ocean-sea ice horizontal grid configuration that allows an increase of the ocean-sea ice component time steps. Ocean biogeochemistry can be activated for fully coupled and semi-coupled carbon cycle applications. This paper describes the model and evaluates its performance using observations and NorESM1-M as benchmarks. The evaluation emphasizes model stability, important large-scale features in the ocean and sea ice components, internal variability in the coupled system, and climate sensitivity. Simulation results from NorESM1-F in general agree well with observational estimates and show evident improvements over NorESM1-M, for example, in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation and sea ice simulation, both important metrics in simulating past and future climates. Whereas NorESM1-M showed a slight global cool bias in the upper oceans, NorESM1-F exhibits a global warm bias. In general, however, NorESM1-F has more similarities than dissimilarities compared to NorESM1-M, and some biases and deficiencies known in NorESM1-M remain.},

abstract = {As a contribution towards improving the climate mean state of the atmosphere and the ocean in Earth system models (ESMs), we compare several coupled simulations conducted with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2) following the HighResMIP protocol. Our simulations allow to analyse the separate effects of increasing the horizontal resolution of the ocean (0.4 to 0.1°) and atmosphere (T127 to T255) submodels, and the effects of substituting the Pacanowski and Philander (PP) vertical ocean mixing scheme with the K-profile parameterization (KPP). The results show clearly distinguishable effects from all three factors. The high resolution in the ocean removes biases in the ocean interior and in the atmosphere. This leads to the important conclusion that a high-resolution ocean has a major impact on the mean state of the ocean and the atmosphere. The T255 atmosphere reduces the surface wind stress and improves ocean mixed layer depths in both hemispheres. The reduced wind forcing, in turn, slows the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), reducing it to observed values. In the North Atlantic, however, the reduced surface wind causes a weakening of the subpolar gyre and thus a slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), when the PP scheme is used. The KPP scheme, on the other hand, causes stronger open-ocean convection which spins up the subpolar gyres, ultimately leading to a stronger and stable AMOC, even when coupled to the T255 atmosphere, thus retaining all the positive effects of a higher-resolved atmosphere.},

abstract = {A new global high-resolution coupled climate model, EC-Earth3P-HR has been developed by the EC-Earth consortium, with a resolution of approximately 40 km for the atmosphere and 0.25° for the ocean, alongside with a standard-resolution version of the model, EC-Earth3P (80 km atmosphere, 1.0 ° ocean). The model forcing and simulations follow the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) protocol. According to this protocol, all simulations are made with both high and standard resolutions. The model has been optimized with respect to scalability, performance, data storage and post-processing. In accordance with the HighResMIP protocol, no specific tuning for the high-resolution version has been applied. Increasing horizontal resolution does not result in a general reduction of biases and overall improvement of the variability, and deteriorating impacts can be detected for specific regions and phenomena such as some Euro-Atlantic weather regimes, whereas others such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation show a clear improvement in their spatial structure. The omission of specific tuning might be responsible for this. The shortness of the spin-up, as prescribed by the HighResMIP protocol, prevented the model from reaching equilibrium. The trend in the control and historical simulations, however, appeared to be similar, resulting in a warming trend, obtained by subtracting the control from the historical simulation, close to the observational one.},

abstract = {Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system is of growing interest, particularly as some recent simulations suggest both the possibility of significant changes in large-scale aspects of circulation as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes. However, such high-resolution global simulations at climate timescales, with resolutions of at least 50 km in the atmosphere and 0.25° in the ocean, have been performed at relatively few research centres and generally without overall coordination, primarily due to their computational cost. Assessing the robustness of the response of simulated climate to model resolution requires a large multi-model ensemble using a coordinated set of experiments. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is the ideal framework within which to conduct such a study, due to the strong link to models being developed for the CMIP DECK experiments and other model intercomparison projects (MIPs). Increases in high-performance computing (HPC) resources, as well as the revised experimental design for CMIP6, now enable a detailed investigation of the impact of increased resolution up to synoptic weather scales on the simulated mean climate and its variability. The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) presented in this paper applies, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution. A coordinated set of experiments has been designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal-resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean. The set of HighResMIP experiments is divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility of extending to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIP, the analysis plan, the connection with the other CMIP6 endorsed MIPs, as well as the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations. HighResMIP thereby focuses on one of the CMIP6 broad questions, "what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?", but we also discuss how it addresses the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) grand challenges.},

abstract = {Systematic improvements in algorithmic design of regional ocean circulation models have led to significant enhancement in simulation ability across a wide range of space/time scales and marine system types. As an example, we briefly review the Regional Ocean Modeling System, a member of a general class of three-dimensional, free-surface, terrain-following numerical models. Noteworthy characteristics of the ROMS computational kernel include: consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers; redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for local variations in the density field; vertical interpolation performed using conservative parabolic splines; and higher-order, quasi-monotone advection algorithms. Examples of quantitative skill assessment are shown for a tidally driven estuary, an ice-covered high-latitude sea, a wind- and buoyancy-forced continental shelf, and a mid-latitude ocean basin. The combination of moderate-order spatial approximations, enhanced conservation properties, and quasi-monotone advection produces both more robust and accurate, and less diffusive, solutions than those produced in earlier terrain-following ocean models. Together with advanced methods of data assimilation and novel observing system technologies, these capabilities constitute the necessary ingredients for multi-purpose regional ocean prediction systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This article describes the new Earth system model (ESM), the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, Earth System version 2 for Long-term simulations (MIROCES2L), using a state-of-the-art climate model as the physical core. This model embeds a terrestrial biogeochemical component with explicit carbon-nitrogen interaction to account for soil nutrient control on plant growth and the land carbon sink. The model's ocean biogeochemical component is largely updated to simulate the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and oxygen such that oceanic primary productivity can be controlled by multiple nutrient limitations. The ocean nitrogen cycle is coupled with the land component via river discharge processes, and external inputs of iron from pyrogenic and lithogenic sources are considered. Comparison of a historical simulation with observation studies showed that the model could reproduce the transient global climate change and carbon cycle as well as the observed large-scale spatial patterns of the land carbon cycle and upper-ocean biogeochemistry. The model demonstrated historical human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle through land use and agriculture and simulated the resultant impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Sensitivity analyses under preindustrial conditions revealed that the simulated ocean biogeochemistry could be altered regionally (and substantially) by nutrient input from the atmosphere and rivers. Based on an idealized experiment in which CO2 was prescribed to increase at a rate of 1{\%}yr-1, the transient climate response (TCR) is estimated to be 1.5 K, i.e., approximately 70{\%} of that from our previous ESM used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The cumulative airborne fraction (AF) is also reduced by 15{\%} because of the intensified land carbon sink, which results in an airborne fraction close to the multimodel mean of the CMIP5 ESMs. The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) is 1.3KEgC-1, i.e., slightly smaller than the average of the CMIP5 ESMs, which suggests that "optimistic" future climate projections will be made by the model. This model and the simulation results contribute to CMIP6. The MIROC-ES2L could further improve our understanding of climate-biogeochemical interaction mechanisms, projections of future environmental changes, and exploration of our future options regarding sustainable development by evolving the processes of climate, biogeochemistry, and human activities in a holistic and interactive manner.},

abstract = {The ammonia cycle and nitrate particle formation are introduced into the LMDz-INCA (Laboratoire de M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologie Dynamique, version 4-INteraction with Chemistry and Aerosols, version 3) global model. An important aspect of this new model is that both fine nitrate particle formation in the accumulation mode and coarse nitrate forming on existing dust and sea-salt particles are considered. The model simulates distributions of nitrates and related species in agreement with previous studies and observations. The calculated present-day total nitrate direct radiative forcing since the pre-industrial is-'0.056 W m-2. This forcing corresponds to 18{\%} of the sulfate forcing. Fine particles largely dominate the nitrate forcing, representing close to 90{\%} of this value. The model has been used to investigate the future changes in nitrates and direct radiative forcing of climate based on snapshot simulations for the four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and for the 2030, 2050, and 2100 time horizons. Due to a decrease in fossil fuel emissions in the future, the concentration of most of the species involved in the nitrate-ammonium-sulfate system drop by 2100 except for ammonia, which originates from agricultural practices and for which emissions significantly increase in the future. Despite the decrease of nitrate surface levels in Europe and North America, the global burden of accumulation mode nitrates increases by up to a factor of 2.6 in 2100. This increase in ammonium nitrate in the future arises despite decreasing NOx emissions due to increased availability of ammonia to form ammonium nitrate. The total aerosol direct forcing decreases from its present-day value of-'0.234 W m-2 to a range of-'0.070 to-'0.130 Wm-2 in 2100 based on the considered scenario. The direct forcing decreases for all aerosols except for nitrates, for which the direct negative forcing increases to a range of-'0.060 to-'0.115 Wm-2 in 2100. Including nitrates in the radiative forcing calculations increases the total direct forcing of aerosols by a factor of 1.3 in 2000, by a factor of 1.7-2.6 in 2030, by 1.9-4.8 in 2050, and by 6.4-8.6 in 2100. These results show that the agricultural emissions of ammonia will play a key role in the future mitigation of climate change, with nitrates becoming the dominant contributor to the anthropogenic aerosol optical depth during the second half of the 21st century and significantly increasing the calculated aerosol direct forcing. This significant increase in the influence that nitrate exerts on climate in the future will at the same time affect regional air quality and nitrogen deposition to the ecosystem.},

The CAS FGOALS-f3-L model, experiment settings, and outputs are all given. In total, there are three ensemble experiments over the period 1979–2014, which are performed with different initial states. The model outputs contain a total of 37 variables and include the required three-hourly mean, six-hourly transient, daily and monthly mean datasets. The baseline performances of the model are validated at different time scales. The preliminary evaluation suggests that the CAS FGOALS-f3-L model can capture the basic patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation well, including the propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, activities of tropical cyclones, and the characterization of extreme precipitation. These datasets contribute to the benchmark of current model behaviors for the desired continuity of CMIP.},

The CAS FGOALS-f3-L model team submitted the piControl run with a near equilibrium ocean state for 561 model years, and 160-year integrations for three ensemble members of abrupt-4× CO2 and 1pctCO2, respectively. The ensemble members restart from the 600, 650 and 700 model years in the piControl run, respectively. The baseline performances of the model are validated in this article. The preliminary evaluation suggests that the CAS FGOALS-f3-L model can preserve the long-term stability well for a mean net radiation flux of 0.31 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere, and a limited decreasing trend of −0.03 W m−2/100 yr. The global annual mean SST is 16.45°C for the 561-year mean, with an increase of 0.03°C/100 yr. The model captures the basic spatial patterns of climate-mean SST and precipitation, but still underestimates the SST over the warm pool. The coupled model mitigates the precipitation bias in the ITCZ compared with the results from CMIP5. Moreover, the model's climate sensitivity represented by the equilibrium climate sensitivity has been reduced from 4.5°C in CMIP5 to 3.0°C in CMIP6. All these datasets contribute to the benchmark of model behaviors for the desired continuity of CMIP.},

abstract = {We describe the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's CM4.0 physical climate model, with emphasis on those aspects that may be of particular importance to users of this model and its simulations. The model is built with the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model and OM4.0 ocean model. Topics include the rationale for key choices made in the model formulation, the stability as well as drift of the preindustrial control simulation, and comparison of key aspects of the historical simulations with observations from recent decades. Notable achievements include the relatively small biases in seasonal spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere fluxes, surface temperature, and precipitation; reduced double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias; dramatically improved representation of ocean boundary currents; a high-quality simulation of climatological Arctic sea ice extent and its recent decline; and excellent simulation of the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation spectrum and structure. Areas of concern include inadequate deep convection in the Nordic Seas; an inaccurate Antarctic sea ice simulation; precipitation and wind composites still affected by the equatorial cold tongue bias; muted variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; strong 100 year quasiperiodicity in Southern Ocean ventilation; and a lack of historical warming before 1990 and too rapid warming thereafter due to high climate sensitivity and strong aerosol forcing, in contrast to the observational record. Overall, CM4.0 scores very well in its fidelity against observations compared to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 generation in terms of both mean state and modes of variability and should prove a valuable new addition for analysis across a broad array of applications.},

abstract = {Global-scale 21st-century glacier mass change projections from six published global glacier models are systematically compared as part of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project. In total 214 projections of annual glacier mass and area forced by 25 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios and aggregated into 19 glacier regions are considered. Global mass loss of all glaciers (outside the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets) by 2100 relative to 2015 averaged over all model runs varies from 18 ± 7{\%} (RCP2.6) to 36 ± 11{\%} (RCP8.5) corresponding to 94 ± 25 and 200 ± 44 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE), respectively. Regional relative mass changes by 2100 correlate linearly with relative area changes. For RCP8.5 three models project global rates of mass loss (multi-GCM means) of {\textgreater}3 mm SLE per year towards the end of the century. Projections vary considerably between regions, and also among the glacier models. Global glacier mass changes per degree global air temperature rise tend to increase with more pronounced warming indicating that mass-balance sensitivities to temperature change are not constant. Differences in glacier mass projections among the models are attributed to differences in model physics, calibration and downscaling procedures, initial ice volumes and varying ensembles of forcing GCMs.},

abstract = {We introduce MPAS-Albany Land Ice (MALI) v6.0, a new variable-resolution land ice model that uses unstructured Voronoi grids on a plane or sphere. MALI is built using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) framework for developing variable-resolution Earth system model components and the Albany multi-physics code base for the solution of coupled systems of partial differential equations, which itself makes use of Trilinos solver libraries. MALI includes a three-dimensional first-order momentum balance solver (Blatter-Pattyn) by linking to the Albany-LI ice sheet velocity solver and an explicit shallow ice velocity solver. The evolution of ice geometry and tracers is handled through an explicit first-order horizontal advection scheme with vertical remapping. The evolution of ice temperature is treated using operator splitting of vertical diffusion and horizontal advection and can be configured to use either a temperature or enthalpy formulation. MALI includes a mass-conserving subglacial hydrology model that supports distributed and/or channelized drainage and can optionally be coupled to ice dynamics. Options for calving include eigencalving, which assumes that the calving rate is proportional to extensional strain rates. MALI is evaluated against commonly used exact solutions and community benchmark experiments and shows the expected accuracy. Results for the MISMIP3d benchmark experiments with MALI's Blatter-Pattyn solver fall between published results from Stokes and L1L2 models as expected. We use the model to simulate a semi-realistic Antarctic ice sheet problem following the initMIP protocol and using 2 km resolution in marine ice sheet regions. MALI is the glacier component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 1, and we describe current and planned coupling to other E3SM components. .},

abstract = {Bias correction is a widely used method to deal with the deficiencies of climate models in representing the current climate. While it is mainly applied to prepare the output of global or regional climate models (GCMs/RCMs) for climate impact assessment, it has also been used recently to correct GCM output before it is downscaled by RCMs. For most RCMs, 3-D atmospheric fields as well as sea surface temperatures (SSTs) should be corrected in order to create forcing fields. The global stretched grid, conformal-cubic atmospheric model (CCAM), is able to run regional simulations with SST-only forcing. Therefore, only the monthly SSTs obtained from the GCM need to be corrected. In previous studies, the climatological bias was removed, while the bias in the temporal variability was still present. In this study, a simple method for correction of the mean and variance is proposed. The impact of the bias correction is tested using global even-grid CCAM simulations forced with raw and corrected SSTs from ACCESS1.0. Results indicate an improved precipitation pattern in the tropics for all seasons using corrected SSTs. There is also a slight improvement in the precipitation pattern in December-February and March-May and in the response to the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation due to the additional variance correction.},

In contrast with GFDL's AM4.0 development effort, which focused on physical and aerosol interactions and which is used as the atmospheric component of CM4.0, AM4.1 focuses on comprehensiveness of Earth system interactions. Key features of this model include doubled horizontal resolution of the atmosphere ({\~{}}200 to {\~{}}100 km) with revised dynamics and physics from GFDL's previous-generation AM3 atmospheric chemistry-climate model. AM4.1 features improved representation of atmospheric chemical composition, including aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions, key land-atmosphere interactions, comprehensive land-atmosphere-ocean cycling of dust and iron, and interactive ocean-atmosphere cycling of reactive nitrogen. AM4.1 provides vast improvements in fidelity over AM3, captures most of AM4.0's baseline simulations characteristics, and notably improves on AM4.0 in the representation of aerosols over the Southern Ocean, India, and China—even with its interactive chemistry representation—and in its manifestation of sudden stratospheric warmings in the coldest months. Distributions of reactive nitrogen and sulfur species, carbon monoxide, and ozone are all substantially improved over AM3. Fidelity concerns include degradation of upper atmosphere equatorial winds and of aerosols in some regions.},

This LMDZ6A version includes original convective parameterizations that define the LMDZ “New Physics”: a mass flux parameterization of the organized structures of the convective boundary layer, the “thermal plume model,” and a parameterization of the cold pools created by reevaporation of convective rainfall. The vertical velocity associated with thermal plumes and gust fronts of cold pools are used to control the triggering and intensity of deep convection. Because of several shortcomings, the early version 5B of this New Physics was worse than the previous “Standard Physics” version 5A regarding several classical climate metrics. To overcome these deficiencies, version 6A includes new developments: a stochastic triggering of deep convection, a modification of the thermal plume model that allows the representation of stratocumulus and cumulus clouds in a unified framework, an improved parameterization of very stable boundary layers, and the modification of the gravity waves scheme targeting the quasi-biennal oscillation in the stratosphere. These improvements to the physical content and a more well-defined tuning strategy led to major improvements in the LMDZ6A version model climatology. Beyond the presentation of this particular model version and documentation of its climatology, the present paper underlines possible methodological pathways toward model improvement that can be shared across modeling groups.},

Here, we present a new model for calculating twenty-first century mass changes of all glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets. ThGlobal Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM) includes mass loss due to frontal ablation marine-terminating glacier fronts and accounts for glacier advance/retreat and surfacelevation changes. Simulations are driven with monthly near-surface air temperaturand precipitation from 14 Global Circulation Models forced by RCP2.6, RCP4.5, anRCP8.5 emission scenarios. Depending on the scenario, the model yields a global glacievolume loss of 25-48{\%} between 2010 and 2100. For calculating glacier contributioto sea-level rise, we account for ice located below sea-level presently displacing oceawater. This effect reduces the glacier contribution by 11-14{\%}, so that our model predicta sea-level equivalent (multi-model mean ±1 standard deviation) of 79±24mm(RCP2.6108±28mm (RCP4.5), and 157±31mm (RCP8.5). Mass losses by frontal ablatioaccount for 10{\%}of total ablation globally, andupto ∼30{\%}regionally. Regional equilibriuline altitudes are projected to rise by ∼100-800m until 2100, but the effect on wastage depends on initial glacier hypsometries.},

abstract = {New experiments were performed with three-dimensional thermomechanical models of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to simulate their behaviour during the glacial cycles, to reconstruct their thickness and extent at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and to estimate their glacio-eustatic contribution to the global sea-level stand. The calculations used improved ice-dynamic and isostatic treatments, updated datasets on higher grid resolutions, and refined climatic treatments based on newly calibrated transfer functions between ice core records and climatic perturbations. Results are discussed from a reference run with standard parameters that is compared with available glacial-geological observations, and from a series of sensitivity experiments focusing on isostatic adjustment, thermomechanical coupling, climatic forcing, mass-balance changes, and basal melting rates and viscosity changes of Antarctic ice shelves. For the Antarctic ice sheet, we find that volume changes are closely linked with grounding line changes of the West Antarctic ice sheet. At the LGM, the grounding line extended close to the continental shelf break almost everywhere. Ice over central East Antarctica was generally thinner than today and varied mainly in accordance with accumulation fluctuations. For the Greenland ice sheet, melting is important only during interglacial periods and the most sensitive period concerns the size of the ice sheet during the Eemian. At the LGM, the Greenland ice sheet extended beyond the present coastline to cover at least the inner continental shelf and thinned by up to several hundred meters in central areas. For a plausible range of parameters, the experiments indicate that at the time of maximum sea-level depression (21 kyr BP), the Antarctic ice sheet contributed 14-18 m to the sea-level lowering, and the Greenland ice sheet 2-3 m, significantly less than the older CLIMAP reconstructions. Whereas both ice sheets were at 21 kyr BP close to their maximum extent, the experiments also indicate that their maximum volumes were reached only by 16.5 kyr BP (Greenland) and 10 kyr BP (Antarctica), equal to an additional sea-level lowering of, respectively, 0.4 and 3.7m. Holocene retreat was essentially complete by 5 kyr BP in Greenland, but is found to still continue today in West Antarctica before reversing to growth during the next millenium. The models were found to reproduce gross features of the ice sheet's history since the LGM in reasonably good agreement with available glacial-geological data, although observational control on ice thickness changes remains very limited. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {An eight-year long reanalysis of atmospheric composition data covering the period 2003-2010 was constructed as part of the FP7-funded Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate project by assimilating satellite data into a global model and data assimilation system. This reanalysis provides fields of chemically reactive gases, namely carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and formaldehyde, as well as aerosols and greenhouse gases globally at a horizontal resolution of about 80 km for both the troposphere and the stratosphere. This paper describes the assimilation system for the reactive gases and presents validation results for the reactive gas analysis fields to document the data set and to give a first indication of its quality. Tropospheric CO values from the MACC reanalysis are on average 10-20{\%} lower than routine observations from commercial aircrafts over airports through most of the troposphere, and have larger negative biases in the boundary layer at urban sites affected by air pollution, possibly due to an underestimation of CO or precursor emissions. Stratospheric ozone fields from the MACC reanalysis agree with ozonesondes and ACE-FTS data to within ±10{\%} in most seasons and regions. In the troposphere the reanalysis shows biases of -5{\%} to +10{\%} with respect to ozonesondes and aircraft data in the extratropics, but has larger negative biases in the tropics. Area-averaged total column ozone agrees with ozone fields from a multi-sensor reanalysis data set to within a few percent. NO2 fields from the reanalysis show the right seasonality over polluted urban areas of the NH and over tropical biomass burning areas, but underestimate wintertime NO2 maxima over anthropogenic pollution regions and overestimate NO2 in northern and southern Africa during the tropical biomass burning seasons. Tropospheric HCHO is well simulated in the MACC reanalysis even though no satellite data are assimilated. It shows good agreement with independent SCIAMACHY retrievals over regions dominated by biogenic emissions with some anthropogenic input, such as the eastern US and China, and also over African regions influenced by biogenic sources and biomass burning. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {The annual and inter-annual variability of the water budget over the Baltic Sea area has been studied using the global climate model ECHAM4/T106 and the regional climate model REMO for three experiments covering a time period of 10 years each. To address the capability of REMO to simulate realistically the water budget over the Baltic Sea re-analyses data (so-called perfect boundaries) were applied as lateral boundary conditions. The validation against observations shows that the results agree rather well. However not all components of the hydrological cycle are observed, therefore only some of them could be compared to the simulation results. A clear dependence of the annual cycle of precipitation from the horizontal resolution was found in the experiments. Until now it is still unclear which processes are responsible for this. Further research will help to identify the sensitive physical processes involved in the water budget and their interactions.},

abstract = {A new regional atmospheric model was set up in a joint effort by DKRZ (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum), DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst), GKSS (Forschungszentrum Geesthacht) at the MPI (Max-Planck-Institut fuer Meteorologie). This model, called REMO (REgional MOdel) can be used in the weather forecast mode as well as in the climate mode. It is based on the Europa-Model (EM), the main weather forecast model of the new numerical weather prediction system of the Deutscher Wetterdienst. In addition to the physical parameterizations implemented in the EM, REMO has the possibility of using the same physics as the global climate model (MPI) into which it is nested to assess the scale dependence of physical parameterizations within the same dynamical framework. This paper gives an overview over different case studies investigating the dependence of model results on simulation domain size, horizontal resolution, initial conditions and lateral boundaries especially for long term calculations. A sample of one month long integrations for an arbitrary July month, a four year long run for the Baltic Sea and its drainage basin and two summer seasons of the Indian Monsoon will be used to demonstrate the sensitivity of regional climate model results to different environments. The sensitivity studies show that it is very important to use realistic large scale driving fields at the lateral boundaries. The regional model results are strongly influenced by the driving fields. The domain size and the simulation length are also influencing the results. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1997.},

abstract = {The past 20 years of research using Earth system models (ESMs) is reviewed with an emphasis on results from the ESM based on MIROC (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) developed in Japan. Earth system models are climate models incorporating biogeochemical processes such as the carbon cycle. The development of ESM was triggered by studies of the feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle. State-of-the-art ESMs are much more realistic than the first ESMs. They now include various biogeochemical processes other than carbon, such as atmospheric chemistry and the nitrogen and iron cycles as well as nutrient transport by atmospheric dust and rivers. They are used to address many practical issues, such as evaluating the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that is consistent with climate change mitigation targets, and are indispensable tools for the development of climate change mitigation policies. Novel, ambitious attempts to use ESMs include coupling socioeconomics with Earth systems, and projecting the carbon cycle on decadal timescales. Development of ESMs requires ongoing integration of multiple aspects of climate science. Emerging applications of ESMs can bring forth meaningful insights, and should be directed toward expanding connections with fields outside climate science, e.g., socioeconomics.

This model version differs from the predecessor model (GISS-E2) chiefly due to parameterization improvements to the atmospheric and ocean model components, while keeping atmospheric resolution the same. Model skill when compared to modern era climatologies is significantly higher than in previous versions. Additionally, updates in forcings have a material impact on the results. In particular, there have been specific improvements in representations of modes of variability (such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation and other modes in the Pacific) and significant improvements in the simulation of the climate of the Southern Oceans, including sea ice. The effective climate sensitivity to 2 × CO2 is slightly higher than previously at 2.7–3.1°C (depending on version) and is a result of lower CO2 radiative forcing and stronger positive feedbacks.},

abstract = {The AeroCom exercise diagnoses multicomponent aerosol modules in global modeling. In an initial assessment simulated global distributions for mass and mid-visible aerosol optical thickness (aot) were compared among 20 different modules. Model diversity was also explored in the context of previous comparisons. For the component combined aot general agreement has improved for the annual global mean. At 0.11 to 0.14, simulated aot values are at the lower end of global averages suggested by remote sensing from ground (AERONET ca. 0.135) and space (satellite composite ca. 0.15). More detailed comparisons, however, reveal that larger differences in regional distribution and significant differences in compositional mixture remain. Of particular concern are large model diversities for contributions by dust and carbonaceous aerosol, because they lead to significant uncertainty in aerosol absorption (aab). Since aot and aab, both, influence the aerosol impact on the radiative energy-balance, the aerosol (direct) forcing uncertainty in modeling is larger than differences in aot might suggest. New diagnostic approaches are proposed to trace model differences in terms of aerosol processing and transport: These include the prescription of common input (e.g. amount, size and injection of aerosol component emissions) and the use of observational capabilities from ground (e.g. measurements networks) or space (e.g. correlations between aerosol and clouds).},

The aerosol module has in this study been implemented and applied in CAM5.3-Oslo. This model is based on CAM5.3-CESM1.2 and its own predecessor model version CAM4-Oslo. OsloAero5.3 has improved treatment of emissions, aerosol chemistry, particle life cycle, and aerosol-cloud interactions compared to its predecessor OsloAero4.0 in CAM4-Oslo. The main new features consist of improved aerosol sources; the module now explicitly accounts for aerosol particle nucleation and secondary organic aerosol production, with new emissions schemes also for sea salt, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and marine primary organics. Mineral dust emissions are updated as well, adopting the formulation of CESM1.2. The improved model representation of aerosol-cloud interactions now resolves heterogeneous ice nucleation based on black carbon (BC) and mineral dust calculated by the model and treats the activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) as in CAM5.3. Compared to OsloAero4.0 in CAM4-Oslo, the black carbon (BC) mass concentrations are less excessive aloft, with a better fit to observations. Near-surface mass concentrations of BC and sea salt aerosols are also less biased, while sulfate and mineral dust are slightly more biased. Although appearing quite similar for CAM5.3-Oslo and CAM4-Oslo, the validation results for organic matter (OM) are inconclusive, since both of the respective versions of OsloAero are equipped with a limited number of OM tracers for the sake of computational efficiency. Any information about the assumed mass ratios of OM to organic carbon (OC) for different types of OM sources is lost in the transport module. Assuming that observed OC concentrations scaled by 1.4 are representative for the modeled OM concentrations, CAM5.3-Oslo with OsloAero5.3 is slightly inferior for the very sparsely available observation data. Comparing clear-sky column-integrated optical properties with data from ground-based remote sensing, we find a negative bias in optical depth globally; however, it is not as strong as in CAM4-Oslo, but has positive biases in some areas typically dominated by mineral dust emissions. Aerosol absorption has a larger negative bias than the optical depth globally. This is reflected in a lower positive bias in areas where mineral dust is the main contributor to absorption. Globally, the low bias in absorption is smaller than in CAM4-Oslo. The {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m parameter exhibits small biases both globally and regionally, suggesting that the aerosol particle sizes are reasonably well represented. Cloud-Top droplet number concentrations over oceans are generally underestimated compared to satellite retrievals, but seem to be overestimated downwind of major emissions of dust and biomass burning sources. Finally, we find small changes in direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, while the cloud radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols is now more negative than in CAM4-Oslo, being on the strong side compared to the multi-model estimate in IPCC AR5. Although not all validation results in this study show improvement for the present CAM5.3-Oslo version, the extended and updated aerosol module OsloAero5.3 is more advanced and applicable than its predecessor OsloAero4.0, as it includes new parameterizations that more readily facilitate sensitivity and process studies and use in climate and Earth system model studies in general.},

abstract = {We introduce ACCESS-OM2, a new version of the ocean-sea ice model of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator. ACCESS-OM2 is driven by a prescribed atmosphere (JRA55-do) but has been designed to form the ocean-sea ice component of the fully coupled (atmosphere-land-ocean-sea ice) ACCESS-CM2 model. Importantly, the model is available at three different horizontal resolutions: a coarse resolution (nominally 1ĝ' horizontal grid spacing), an eddy-permitting resolution (nominally 0.25ĝ' ), and an eddy-rich resolution (0.1ĝ' with 75 vertical levels); the eddy-rich model is designed to be incorporated into the Bluelink operational ocean prediction and reanalysis system. The different resolutions have been developed simultaneously, both to allow for testing at lower resolutions and to permit comparison across resolutions. In this paper, the model is introduced and the individual components are documented. The model performance is evaluated across the three different resolutions, highlighting the relative advantages and disadvantages of running ocean-sea ice models at higher resolution. We find that higher resolution is an advantage in resolving flow through small straits, the structure of western boundary currents, and the abyssal overturning cell but that there is scope for improvements in sub-grid-scale parameterizations at the highest resolution.},

abstract = {The future surface mass balance (SMB) will influence the ice dynamics and the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to the sea level rise. Most of recent Antarctic SMB projections were based on the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). However, new CMIP6 results have revealed a +1.3 °C higher mean Antarctic near-surface temperature than in CMIP5 at the end of the 21st century, enabling estimations of future SMB in warmer climates. Here, we investigate the AIS sensitivity to different warmings with an ensemble of four simulations performed with the polar regional climate model Modele Atmospherique Regional (MAR) forced by two CMIP5 and two CMIP6 models over 1981-2100. Statistical extrapolation enables us to expand our results to the whole CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles. Our results highlight a contrasting effect on the future grounded ice sheet and the ice shelves. The SMB over grounded ice is projected to increase as a response to stronger snowfall, only partly offset by enhanced meltwater run-off. This leads to a cumulated sealevel-rise mitigation (i.e. an increase in surface mass) of the grounded Antarctic surface by 5.1±1.9 cm sea level equivalent (SLE) in CMIP5-RCP8.5 (Relative Concentration Pathway 8.5) and 6.3±2.0 cm SLE in CMIP6-ssp585 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 585). Additionally, the CMIP6 low-emission ssp126 and intermediate-emission ssp245 scenarios project a stabilized surface mass gain, resulting in a lower mitigation to sea level rise than in ssp585. Over the ice shelves, the strong run-off increase associated with higher temperature is projected to decrease the SMB (more strongly in CMIP6-ssp585 compared to CMIP5-RCP8.5). Ice shelves are however predicted to have a close-to-present-equilibrium stable SMB under CMIP6 ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios. Future uncertainties are mainly due to the sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing and the timing of the projected warming. While ice shelves should remain at a close-to-equilibrium stable SMB under the Paris Agreement, MAR projects strong SMB decrease for an Antarctic near-surface warming above C2.5 °C compared to 1981-2010 mean temperature, limiting the warming range before potential irreversible damages on the ice shelves. Finally, our results reveal the existence of a potential threshold (C7.5 °C) that leads to a lower grounded-SMB increase. This however has to be confirmed in following studies using more extreme or longer future scenarios.},

abstract = {Although the use of a damping layer near the top of a computational model domain has proven effective in absorbing upward-propagating gravity-wave energy in idealized simulations, this technique has been less successful in real atmospheric applications. Here, a new technique is proposed for nonhydrostatic model equations that are solved using split-explicit time-integration techniques. In this method, an implicit Rayleigh damping term is applied only to the vertical velocity, as a final adjustment at the end of each small (acoustic) time step. The adjustment is equivalent to including an implicit Rayleigh damping term in the vertical momentum equation together with an implicit vertical diffusion of w, and could be applied in this manner in other time-integration schemes. This implicit damping for the vertical velocity is unconditionally stable and remains effective even for hydrostatic gravity waves. The good absorption characteristics of this layer across a wide range of horizontal scales are confirmed through analysis of the linear wave equation and numerical mountain-wave simulations, and through simulations of an idealized squall line and of mountain waves over the Colorado Rocky Mountains. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

The Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme (MOSES) and the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model are described and compared. The impact on the simulated present day land surface climatology is assessed, in both atmosphere only and coupled model cases. Analysis is focused on seasonal mean precipitation and screen-level temperature, both globally and for Australia. Many of the biases from observations are common across both ACCESS versions and both atmosphere only and coupled cases. Where the simulations from the two versions differ, the choice of land surface model is often only a small contributor with changes to the cloud simulation also important. Differences that can be traced to the land surface model include warm biases with CABLE due to underestimation of surface albedo, better timing of northern hemisphere snowmelt and smaller seasonal and diurnal temperature ranges with CABLE than MOSES.

abstract = {Glaciers in the high mountains of Asia (HMA) make a substantial contribution to the water supply of millions of people, and they are retreating and losing mass as a result of anthropogenic climate change at similar rates to those seen elsewhere. In the Paris Agreement of 2015, 195 nations agreed on the aspiration to limit the level of global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) above pre-industrial levels. However, it is not known what an increase of 1.5 °C would mean for the glaciers in HMA. Here we show that a global temperature rise of 1.5 °C will lead to a warming of 2.1 ± 0.1 °C in HMA, and that 64 ± 7 per cent of the present-day ice mass stored in the HMA glaciers will remain by the end of the century. The 1.5 °C goal is extremely ambitious and is projected by only a small number of climate models of the conservative IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 ensemble. Projections for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 reveal that much of the glacier ice is likely to disappear, with projected mass losses of 49 ± 7 per cent, 51 ± 6 per cent and 64 ± 5 per cent, respectively, by the end of the century; these projections have potentially serious consequences for regional water management and mountain communities.},

Scientific performance is compared to both observations and the N216ORCA025 model. N96ORCA1 reproduces observed climate mean and variability almost as well as N216ORCA025. Patterns of biases are similar across the two models. In the northwest Atlantic, N96ORCA1 shows a cold surface bias of up to 6 K, typical of ocean models of this resolution. The strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (16 to 17 Sv) matches observations. In the Southern Ocean, a warm surface bias (up to 2 K) is smaller than in N216ORCA025 and linked to improved ocean circulation. Model El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability are close to observations. Both the cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere (N96ORCA1) and the warm bias in the Southern Hemisphere (N216ORCA025) develop in the first few decades of the simulations. As in many comparable climate models, simulated interhemispheric gradients of top-of-atmosphere radiation are larger than observations suggest, with contributions from both hemispheres.

Over the Antarctic continent, modeled snow grain size exhibits expected behavior. The agreement between modeled and observed albedo at Neumayer, Dronning Maud Land, is very good, and subtle variability in albedo is well captured by the model. December-February mean differences in modeled and observed net shortwave radiation range from -8.7 to +3.8 W m-2 between 1995 and 2004, with a mean value of -2.7 W m-2. This is a considerable improvement compared to the previous albedo parameterization in the model, which led to overestimates of the net shortwave fluxes by +15.0 to +22.7 W m-2, or 40-55{\%} of the observed net shortwave flux, in the same period.

abstract = {A hindcast experiment of the Mediterranean present-day climate is performed using a fully-coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Regional Climate Model (AORCM) for the Mediterranean basin. The new model, called LMDz-NEMO-Med, is composed of LMDz4-regional as atmospheric component and of NEMOMED8 as oceanic component. This AORCM equilibrates freely, without any flux adjustment, neither in fresh water nor in heat. At its atmospheric lateral boundary conditions, it is driven by ERA-40 data from 1958 to 2001, after a spin-up of 40 years in coupled configuration. The model performance is assessed and compared with available observational datasets. The model skill in reproducing mean state and inter-annual variability of main atmospheric and oceanic surface fields is in line with that of state-of-the-art AORCMs. Considering the ocean behaviour, the inter-annual variations of the basin-scale heat content are in very good agreement with the observations. The model results concerning salt content could not be adequately validated. High inter-annual variability of deep convection in the Gulf of Lion is simulated, with 53 {\%} of convective winters, representative of the present climate state. The role of different factors influencing the deep convection and its inter-annual variability is examined, including dynamic and hydrostatic ocean preconditioning and atmospheric surface forcing. A conceptual framework is outlined and validated in linking the occurrence of deep convection to the efficiency of the integrated surface buoyancy fluxes along the winter season to mix the initially stratified averaged water column down to the convective threshold depth. This simple framework (based only on 2 independent variables) is able to explain 60 {\%} (resp. 69 {\%}) of inter-annual variability of the deep water formation rate (resp. maximum mixed layer depth) for the West Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) formation process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The observations indicate a relative increase in hydrogen peroxide by approximately 50{\%} since 1900, with most of the change since the early 1970s. Using two model simulations spanning 1850 to present, we show that the modeled relative change in annual-mean surface hydrogen peroxide parallels the equivalent signal from the ice core record. In addition, we show that this relative change can be explained by the relative changes in tropospheric ozone concentration and mostly in ozone photolysis rates (J(O1D)). The simulated signal is therefore intimately related to the changes in stratospheric ozone associated with increases in chlorofluorocarbons; this is further demonstrated using total ozone column observations and the associated observed change in ice-core hydrogen peroxide.

abstract = {We present and discuss a new dataset of gridded emissions covering the historical period (1850-2000) in decadal increments at a horizontal resolution of 0.5° in latitude and longitude. The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program {\#}5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate and black carbon deposition over Greenland is in very good agreement with the ice-core observations spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are shown to be in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {Ice flow models used to project the mass balance of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica usually rely on the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) and the Shallow-Shelf Approximation (SSA), sometimes combined into so-called "hybrid" models. Such models, while computationally efficient, are based on a simplified set of physical assumptions about the mechanical regime of the ice flow, which does not uniformly apply everywhere on the ice sheet/ice shelf system, especially near grounding lines, where rapid changes are taking place at present. Here, we present a new thermomechanical finite element model of ice flow named ISSM (Ice Sheet System Model) that includes higher-order stresses, high spatial resolution capability and data assimilation techniques to better capture ice dynamics and produce realistic simulations of ice sheet flow at the continental scale. ISSM includes several approximations of the momentum balance equations, ranging from the two-dimensional SSA to the three-dimensional full-Stokes formulation. It also relies on a massively parallelized architecture and state-of-the-art scalable tools. ISSM employs data assimilation techniques, at all levels of approximation of the momentum balance equations, to infer basal drag at the ice-bed interface from satellite radar interferometry-derived observations of ice motion. Following a validation of ISSM with standard benchmarks, we present a demonstration of its capability in the case of the Greenland Ice Sheet. We show ISSM is able to simulate the ice flow of an entire ice sheet realistically at a high spatial resolution, with higher-order physics, thereby providing a pathway for improving projections of ice sheet evolution in a warming climate.

New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere.

abstract = {The impact of lakes on climate is investigated in a set of global simulations performed with the CNRM-CM5 climate model coupled to the FLake lake scheme. First, offline simulations driven by ERA-Interim (ERA-I hereafter) reanalysis are performed on a limited set of lakes to find the best FLake parameters setting. Optimal values of lake depth, ice albedo and light extinction coefficient are defined by evaluating the model's performance in different climates for surface temperature and lake ice duration. Second, global simulations are performed with and without FLake to assess the impact of lake representation on the surface energy balance and the boundary layer characteristics. Results indicate that FLake simulates the lake surface temperature satisfactorily in an offline mode and that the use of FLake coupled to CNRM-CM5 improves some of the global biases found in the climate model. It is also shown that lakes impact the surface energy budget significantly at a regional scale; however, the impact on climate is rather limited. Finally, future developments related to the implementation of a more physical snow model and a water balance in FLake are discussed.},

Many modeling groups participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) have been working towards multi-model ensemble approach that have become a standard technique for projecting future climate and for assessing associated uncertainties to deal with intrinsic shortcomings of climate models. Within this context, the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences/Korea Meteorological Administration (NIMS/KMA) has developed the KMA Advanced Community Earth-system model (K-ACE) under KMA-Met Office collaboration for climate research. This paper provides general descriptions of the first generation K-ACE model including the coupling strategy, as well as preliminary evaluations of the model performance in mean climate fields. The first generation K-ACE model appears to capture the mean climatology and the inter-annual variability of the observed climate. Horizontal distributions and the variability of the surface and pressure-level variables agree well with observations with correlation coefficients of 0.88–0.99 and 0.69–0.99, respectively. Measured in terms of performance index between the observed and simulated fields, the K-ACE performance is comparable with those of 29 CMIP5 models. This study also identifies key weaknesses of the K-ACE in the present-day climate. Improving these deficiencies will be a topic of future studies. The NIMS/KMA will employ the K-ACE model to contribute to the CMIP6 experiment.},

abstract = {We construct initial conditions for an ice flow model of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). GrIS has been losing mass at an increasing rate over the past two decades, and a significant proportion of this loss is due to dynamic thinning of narrow outlet glaciers. We solve an inverse problem to estimate poorly known basal and englacial parameters given observed geometry and surface velocities. A weighted cost function, resolved to 4 km in the interior of the ice sheet and 1 km in regions of fast-flowing ice at the margin, is minimized to find two-dimensional fields for a stiffness factor, which is a coefficient of the effective viscosity, and basal traction coefficient. Using these fields, we run the model under present-day climate to damp large-amplitude, short-wavelength fluctuations in the flux divergence. The time-dependent model uses an adaptive mesh with resolution ranging from 8 km of the base grid to 500 m in areas of fast-flowing ice to capture the behaviour of the main outlet glaciers. The ice discharge calculated from the initial conditions for GrIS and individual glaciers compares well with values calculated from observations.},

Using a demonstrative grid size of 10 × 10 km2, we show that differences in downward surface solar fluxes for a clear sky without aerosols between the 3-D model and the conventional plane-parallel radiative transfer scheme are substantial, on the order of 200 W/m2 at shaded or sunward slopes. Deviations in the reflected fluxes of the direct solar beam amount to about +100 W/m2 over snow-covered areas, which would lead to an enhanced snowmelt if the 3-D topography effects had been accounted for in current climate models. We further demonstrate that the entire Tibetan Plateau would receive more solar flux by about 14 W/m2, if its 3-D mountain structure was included in the calculations, which would result in larger sensible and latent heat transfer from the surface to the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Several innovative physical and chemical parameterizations, including trigger functions for deep convection, cloud macrophysics, aerosol, and three-dimensional radiation-topography interaction, as well as a one-dimensional mixed-layer model optional for the atmosphere component, are incorporated. The precipitation variability, such as diurnal cycle and propagation of convection systems, is improved in TaiESM. TaiESM demonstrates good model stability in the 500-year preindustrial simulation in terms of the net flux at the top of the model, surface temperatures, and sea ice concentration. In the historical simulation, although the warming before 1935 is weak, TaiESM captures the increasing trend of temperature after 1950 well. The current climatology of TaiESM during 1979-2005 is evaluated by observational and reanalysis datasets. Cloud amounts are too large in TaiESM, but their cloud forcing is only slightly weaker than observational data. The mean bias of the sea surface temperature is almost 0, whereas the surface air temperatures over land and sea ice regions exhibit cold biases. The overall performance of TaiESM is above average among models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, particularly in that the bias of precipitation is smallest. However, several common discrepancies shared by most models still exist, such as the double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias in precipitation and warm bias over the Southern Ocean. .},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present the validation over Greenland of a thermodynamic snow-ice model that was complemented with the snow metamorphism and albedo parameterizations of the Centre d'Etudes de la Neige (Grenoble, France) in order to make the surface albedo variable and interactive. Special attention is given to the surface albedo since it is the most important parameter in energy exchanges with the atmosphere for snow and ice melt. The development of an integrated (snow, ice, and water) albedo model takes into account the different surface types observed on an ice sheet, and the snow albedo is calculated from the simulated surface snow grains. The validation for a polar site has been done at ETH Camp (West Greenland, 1155 m above sea level) during the 1990 and 1991 summer seasons. Although both ablation seasons differed greatly (in 1990 it showed a negative mass balance while in 1991 it ended with a positive mass balance), a single model configuration was able to provide good results for both 1990 and 1991. These simulations show that the snow metamorphism laws included enable an accurate simulation of the surface albedo and henceforth of the surface mass balance for a polar site, provided that the snow model is correctly forced at its surface level and that meltwater retention, percolation, and drainage are well represented in the snow model. The model results are also compared with two other modeling approaches, and differences between the three snow models are detailed.},

We use the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2.1/ANT with a high horizontal resolution (27 km), equipped with a drifting snow routine and forced by ERA-Interim (1989–2009) at its lateral and ocean boundaries. Drifting snow sublimation (SUds) is significant in Antarctica, especially in the coastal regions ({\textgreater}150 mm water equivalent yr−1). Integrated over the ice sheet, SUds removes ∼6{\%} of the annually precipitated snow. Drifting snow interacts with the atmosphere, as it increases the lower atmospheric moisture content and reduces surface sublimation (SUs), and leads to increased snowfall in regions where the atmosphere usually is close to saturation. Drifting snow sublimation (SUds) is smallest in summer, when katabatic wind speeds are lower and melting and surface sublimation consolidate the snow surface. Compared to a simulation without drifting snow, total sublimation (SUds + SUs) doubles on the grounded ice sheet if drifting snow is considered. Drifting snow erosion is locally significant, but can be neglected on a continent-wide scale.},

abstract = {Convection-resolving models allow to explicitly resolve deep convection at horizontal grid spacings of O(1 km). On current supercomputers, refining the grid spacing to the kilometer scale is computationally still extremely demanding, and therefore, climate simulations at this resolution have so far largely been limited to subcontinental computational domains. However, new supercomputers that mix conventional multicore CPUs and accelerators possess properties beneficial for climate codes. Exploiting these capabilities allows expansion of the size of the computational domains to continental scales. Here we present such a convection-resolving climate simulation, using a version of the COSMO model, capable of exploiting GPU accelerators. The simulation has a grid spacing of 2.2 km, 1536 × 1536 × 60 grid points, covers the period 1999-2008, and is driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. An assessment of the 10-year-long simulation is conducted using a wide range of data sets, including several rain gauge networks, energy balance stations, and a remotely sensed lightning data set. Substantial improvements are found for the 2 km simulation in terms of the diurnal cycles of precipitation. This confirms results found in studies using smaller computational domains. However, the continental-scale simulations also reveal deficiencies such as substantial performance differences between regions with and without strong orographic forcing. Analysis of the statistical distribution of updrafts and downdrafts shows an increase of the amplitude in seasons with convection and a pronounced asymmetry between updrafts and downdrafts. Furthermore, the analysis of lightning data shows that the convection-resolving simulation is able to reproduce important features of the annual cycle of deep convection in Europe.},

abstract = {The sea level contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet constitutes a large uncertainty in future sea level projections. Here we apply a linear response theory approach to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models to estimate the Antarctic ice sheet contribution from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century. The purpose of this computation is to estimate the uncertainty of Antarctica's future contribution to global sea level rise that arises from large uncertainty in the oceanic forcing and the associated ice shelf melting. Ice shelf melting is considered to be a major if not the largest perturbation of the ice sheet's flow into the ocean. However, by computing only the sea level contribution in response to ice shelf melting, our study is neglecting a number of processes such as surface-mass-balance-related contributions. In assuming linear response theory, we are able to capture complex temporal responses of the ice sheets, but we neglect any self-dampening or self-amplifying processes. This is particularly relevant in situations in which an instability is dominating the ice loss. The results obtained here are thus relevant, in particular wherever the ice loss is dominated by the forcing as opposed to an internal instability, for example in strong ocean warming scenarios. In order to allow for comparison the methodology was chosen to be exactly the same as in an earlier study (Levermann et al., 2014) but with 16 instead of 5 ice sheet models. We include uncertainty in the atmospheric warming response to carbon emissions (full range of CMIP5 climate model sensitivities), uncertainty in the oceanic transport to the Southern Ocean (obtained from the time-delayed and scaled oceanic subsurface warming in CMIP5 models in relation to the global mean surface warming), and the observed range of responses of basal ice shelf melting to oceanic warming outside the ice shelf cavity. This uncertainty in basal ice shelf melting is then convoluted with the linear response functions of each of the 16 ice sheet models to obtain the ice flow response to the individual global warming path. The model median for the observational period from 1992 to 2017 of the ice loss due to basal ice shelf melting is 10.2 mm, with a likely range between 5.2 and 21.3 mm. For the same period the Antarctic ice sheet lost mass equivalent to 7.4mm of global sea level rise, with a standard deviation of 3.7mm (Shepherd et al., 2018) including all processes, especially surface-mass-balance changes. For the unabated warming path, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), we obtain a median contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global mean sea level rise from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century of 17 cm, with a likely range (66th percentile around the mean) between 9 and 36 cm and a very likely range (90th percentile around the mean) between 6 and 58 cm. For the RCP2.6 warming path, which will keep the global mean temperature below 2 °C of global warming and is thus consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, the procedure yields a median of 13 cm of global mean sea level contribution. The likely range for the RCP2.6 scenario is between 7 and 24 cm, and the very likely range is between 4 and 37 cm. The structural uncertainties in the method do not allow for an interpretation of any higher uncertainty percentiles.We provide projections for the five Antarctic regions and for each model and each scenario separately. The rate of sea level contribution is highest under the RCP8.5 scenario. The maximum within the 21st century of the median value is 4 cm per decade, with a likely range between 2 and 9 cm per decade and a very likely range between 1 and 14 cm per decade.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the skills of the regional climate model Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling in Climate Mode (CCLM) in reproducing historical climatic features and their added value to the driving global climate models (GCMs) of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-East Asia (CORDEX-EA) domain. An ensemble of climate simulations, with a resolution of 0.44°, was conducted by downscaling four GCMs: CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, HadGEM2, and MPI-ESM-LR. The CCLM outputs were compared with different observations and reanalysis datasets. Results showed strong seasonal variability of CCLM's ability in reproducing climatological means, variability, and extremes. The bias of the simulated summer temperatures is generally smaller than that of the winter temperatures; in addition, areas where CCLM adds value to the driving GCMs in simulating temperature are larger in the winter than in the summer. CCLM outperforms GCMs in terms of generating climatological precipitation means and daily precipitation distributions for most regions in the winter, but this is not always the case for the summer. It was found that CCLM biases are partly inherited from GCMs and are significantly shaped by structural biases of CCLM. Furthermore, downscaled simulations show added value in capturing features of consecutive wet days for the tropics and of consecutive dry days for areas to the north of 30°N. We found considerable uncertainty from reanalysis and observation datasets in temperatures and precipitation climatological means for some regions that rival bias values of GCMs and CCLM simulations. We recommend carefully selecting reference datasets when evaluating modeled climate means.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model: Grid-Point Version 3 (FGOALS-g3) and evaluates its basic performance based on some of its participation in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) experiments. Our results show that many significant improvements have been achieved by FGOALS-g3 in terms of climatological mean states, variabilities, and long-term trends. For example, FGOALS-g3 has a small (−0.015°C/100 yr) climate drift in 700-yr preindustrial control (piControl) runs and smaller biases in climatological mean variables, such as the land/sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and seasonal soil moisture cycle, compared with its previous version FGOALS-g2 during the historical period. The characteristics of climate variabilities, for example, Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) eastward/westward propagation ratios, spatial patterns of interannual variability of tropical SST anomalies, and relationship between the East Asian Summer Monsoon and El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are well captured by FGOALS-g3. In particular, the cooling trend of globally averaged surface temperature during 1940–1970, which is a challenge for most CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, is well reproduced by FGOALS-g3 in historical runs. In addition to the external forcing factors recommended by CMIP6, anthropogenic groundwater forcing from 1965 to 2014 was incorporated into the FGOALS-g3 historical runs.},

abstract = {The improvements and validation of several parameterization schemes in the second version of the Beijing Climate Center Atmosphere-Vegetation Interaction Model (BCC{\_}AVIM2.0) are introduced in this study. The main updates include a replacement of the water-only lake module by the common land model lake module (CoLM-lake) with a more realistic snow-ice-water-soil framework, a parameterization scheme for rice paddies added in the vegetation module, renewed parameterizations of snow cover fraction and snow surface albedo to accommodate the varied snow aging effect during different stages of a snow season, a revised parameterization to calculate the threshold temperature to initiate freeze (thaw) of soil water (ice) rather than being fixed at 0°C in BCC{\_}AVIM1.0, a prognostic phenology scheme for vegetation growth instead of empirically prescribed dates for leaf onset/fall, and a renewed scheme to depict solar radiation transfer through the vegetation canopy. The above updates have been implemented in BCC{\_}AVIM2.0 to serve as the land component of the BCC Climate System Model (BCC{\_}CSM). Preliminary results of BCC{\_}AVIM in the ongoing Land Surface, Snow, and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show that the overall performance of BCC{\_}AVIM2.0 is better than that of BCC{\_}AVIM1.0 in the simulation of surface energy budgets at the seasonal timescale. Comparing the simulations of annual global land average before and after the updates in BCC{\_}AVIM2.0 reveals that the bias of net surface radiation is reduced from −12.0 to −11.7 W m−2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced from 20.6 to 19.0 W m−2; the bias and RMSE of latent heat flux are reduced from 2.3 to −0.1 W m−2 and from 15.4 to 14.3 W m−2, respectively; the bias of sensible heat flux is increased from 2.5 to 5.1 W m−2 but the RMSE is reduced from 18.4 to 17.0 W m−2.},

Aerosols' direct and indirect effects are prescribed using the MACv2-SP approach and data sets.

Prominent improvements include alleviated double Intertropical Convergence Zone problem, increased marine boundary layer clouds, and better El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation amplitude and periods. One deficiency of the model is the significantly underestimated Arctic and Antarctic sea ice in warm seasons. The historical warming is about 0.55 °C greater than observations toward 2014. CIESM has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.67 K, mainly resulted from increased positive shortwave cloud feedback. Our efforts on porting and redesigning CIESM for the heterogeneous Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer are also introduced, including some ongoing developments toward a future version of the model.},

abstract = {Cities are unique environments where anthropogenic waste heat from energy consumption changes the dynamics of the boundary layer, affecting temperatures, pollution dispersion and buoyancy-driven flows. Although urban environments are important for societal wellbeing, there are relatively few models that link predictions of waste heat variability with urban climate interactions. This study presents the Urban Climate and Energy Model (UCLEM): a new physically based model representing important heat transfer processes between the atmosphere, external and internal urban environments, combined with a statistical model of human behaviours relating to energy use. The aim of UCLEM is to efficiently predict the climatology of different urban areas, as well as the energy used to maintain comfortable temperatures within buildings. The model is designed to be easily adaptable to a wide range of urban settings with adjustable parameters including building height, density, material thermal and radiative characteristics and vegetation fractions. We assess UCLEM's ability to predict energy consumption for a neighbourhood of Melbourne, Australia, forced by local flux tower observations and evaluated at half-hourly intervals over 12 months. Results are presented in four development stages to assess various levels of physical and behavioural model complexity. We show that more complete physical representations can improve average daily energy consumption predictions; however, sub-daily patterns of energy use are improved only by combining the physics-based model with a statistical model of human behaviour. At the final stage, as well as predicting surface–atmosphere radiant and turbulent fluxes, UCLEM estimates neighbourhood energy demand with a normalised mean error of 11.5{\%} and a computation time on a single processor of about 1 s per simulation year.},

abstract = {A modal aerosol module (MAM) has been developed for the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). MAM is capable of simulating the aerosol size distribution and both internal and external mixing between aerosol components, treating numerous complicated aerosol processes and aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties in a physically-based manner. Two MAM versions were developed: a more complete version with seven lognormal modes (MAM7), and a version with three lognormal modes (MAM3) for the purpose of long-term (decades to centuries) simulations. In this paper a description and evaluation of the aerosol module and its two representations are provided. Sensitivity of the aerosol lifecycle to simplifications in the representation of aerosol is discussed. Simulated sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass concentrations are remarkably similar between MAM3 and MAM7. Differences in primary organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) concentrations between MAM3 and MAM7 are also small (mostly within 10{\%}). The mineral dust global burden differs by 10{\%} and sea salt burden by 30-40{\%} between MAM3 and MAM7, mainly due to the different size ranges for dust and sea salt modes and different standard deviations of the log-normal size distribution for sea salt modes between MAM3 and MAM7. The model is able to qualitatively capture the observed geographical and temporal variations of aerosol mass and number concentrations, size distributions, and aerosol optical properties. However, there are noticeable biases; e.g., simulated BC concentrations are significantly lower than measurements in the Arctic. There is a low bias in modeled aerosol optical depth on the global scale, especially in the developing countries. These biases in aerosol simulations clearly indicate the need for improvements of aerosol processes (e.g., emission fluxes of anthropogenic aerosols and precursor gases in developing countries, boundary layer nucleation) and properties (e.g., primary aerosol emission size, POM hygroscopicity). In addition, the critical role of cloud properties (e.g., liquid water content, cloud fraction) responsible for the wet scavenging of aerosol is highlighted. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols play an important role in the climate system by influencing the Earth's radiation budgets and modifying the cloud properties. Despite the importance, their representations in large-scale atmospheric models are still crude, which can influence model simulated burden, lifetime, physical, chemical and optical properties, and the climate forcing of carbonaceous aerosols. In this study, we improve the current three-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM3) in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) by introducing an additional primary carbon mode to explicitly account for the microphysical ageing of primary carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere. Compared to MAM3, the four-mode version of MAM (MAM4) significantly increases the column burdens of primary particulate organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) by up to 40{\%} in many remote regions, where in-cloud scavenging plays an important role in determining the aerosol concentrations. Differences in the column burdens for other types of aerosol (e.g., sulfate, secondary organic aerosols, mineral dust, sea salt) are less than 1{\%}. Evaluating the MAM4 simulation against in situ surface and aircraft observations, we find that MAM4 significantly improves the simulation of seasonal variation of near-surface BC concentrations in the polar regions, by increasing the BC concentrations in all seasons and particularly in cold seasons. However, it exacerbates the overestimation of modeled BC concentrations in the upper troposphere in the Pacific regions. The comparisons suggest that, to address the remaining model POM and BC biases, future improvements are required related to (1) in-cloud scavenging and vertical transport in convective clouds and (2) emissions of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols.},

The model reproduces satisfactorily the near-surface temperature and precipitation characteristics over most part of North America. Coastal and mountainous zones remain problematic: a cold bias (2-6 °C) prevails over Rocky Mountains in summertime and all year-round over Mexico; winter precipitation in mountainous coastal regions is overestimated. The precipitation patterns related to the North American Monsoon are well reproduced, except on its northern limit. The spatial and temporal structure of the Great Plains Low-Level Jet is well reproduced by the model; however, the night-time precipitation maximum in the jet area is underestimated. The performance of CRCM5 was assessed against earlier CRCM versions and other RCMs. CRCM5 is shown to have been substantially improved compared to CRCM3 and CRCM4 in terms of seasonal mean statistics, and to be comparable to other modern RCMs. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {We present estimates of sea-level change caused by the global surface mass balance of glaciers, based on the reconstruction and projection of the surface mass balance of all the individual glaciers of the world, excluding the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The model is validated using a leave-one-glacier-out cross-validation scheme against 3997 observed surface mass balances of 255 glaciers, and against 756 geodetically observed, temporally integrated volume and surface area changes of 341 glaciers. When forced with observed monthly precipitation and temperature data, the glaciers of the world are reconstructed to have lost mass corresponding to 114 ± 5 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE) between 1902 and 2009. Using projected temperature and precipitation anomalies from 15 coupled general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, they are projected to lose an additional 148 ± 35 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 166 ± 42 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), 175 ± 40 mm SLE (scenario RCP60), or 217 ± 47 mm SLE (scenario RCP85) during the 21st century. Based on the extended RCP scenarios, glaciers are projected to approach a new equilibrium towards the end of the 23rd century, after having lost either 248 ± 66 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 313 ± 50 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), or 424 ± 46 mm SLE (scenario RCP85). Up until approximately 2100, ensemble uncertainty within each scenario is the biggest source of uncertainty for the future glacier mass loss; after that, the difference between the scenarios takes over as the biggest source of uncertainty. Ice mass loss rates are projected to peak 2040 ∼ 2050 (RCP26), 2050 ∼ 2060 (RCP45), 2070 ∼ 2090 (RCP60), or 2070 ∼ 2100 (RCP85). {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

We present an ensemble of 288 glacier mass and area change projections for the 21st century based on 11 glacier models using up to 10 general circulation models and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) as boundary conditions. We partition the total uncertainty into the individual contributions caused by glacier models, general circulation models, RCPs, and natural variability. We find that emission scenario uncertainty is growing throughout the 21st century and is the largest source of uncertainty by 2100. The relative importance of glacier model uncertainty decreases over time, but it is the greatest source of uncertainty until the middle of this century. The projection uncertainty associated with natural variability is small on the global scale but can be large on regional scales. The projected global mass loss by 2100 relative to 2015 (79 ± 56 mm sea level equivalent for RCP2.6, 159 ± 86 mm sea level equivalent for RCP8.5) is lower than, but well within, the uncertainty range of previous projections.},

abstract = {A new release of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2) is presented. The development focused on correcting errors in and improving the physical processes representation, as well as improving the computational performance, versatility, and overall user friendliness. In addition to new radiation and aerosol parameterizations of the atmosphere, several relatively large, but partly compensating, coding errors in the model's cloud, convection, and turbulence parameterizations were corrected. The representation of land processes was refined by introducing a multilayer soil hydrology scheme, extending the land biogeochemistry to include the nitrogen cycle, replacing the soil and litter decomposition model and improving the representation of wildfires. The ocean biogeochemistry now represents cyanobacteria prognostically in order to capture the response of nitrogen fixation to changing climate conditions and further includes improved detritus settling and numerous other refinements. As something new, in addition to limiting drift and minimizing certain biases, the instrumental record warming was explicitly taken into account during the tuning process. To this end, a very high climate sensitivity of around 7 K caused by low-level clouds in the tropics as found in an intermediate model version was addressed, as it was not deemed possible to match observed warming otherwise. As a result, the model has a climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 over preindustrial conditions of 2.77 K, maintaining the previously identified highly nonlinear global mean response to increasing CO2 forcing, which nonetheless can be represented by a simple two-layer model.},

Increasing the resolution from 1° to 0.25° in the atmosphere (same physics) coupled to the 1° ocean intensifies the strength of the storm tracks closer to observations. The 0.25° atmosphere with the older CESM1.1 physics coupled to the 0.1° ocean has fewer low clouds, warmer Southern Ocean sea surface temperatures, a weaker meridional temperature gradient, and a degraded storm track simulation compared to the 0.25° atmosphere with CESM1.3 physics coupled to the 1° ocean. Therefore, deficient physics in the atmospheric model can negate the gains attained by higher resolution in atmosphere and ocean.},

CNRM-CM6-1 is the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model including prescribed aerosols and a linear stratospheric ozone scheme, while the Earth System Model CNRM-ESM2-1 has interactive tropospheric aerosols and chemistry of the midtroposphere aloft. The representations of aerosols and ozone in CNRM-CM6-1 are issued from simulations of CNRM-ESM2-1, and this ensures some comparability of both representations. In particular, present-day anthropogenic aerosol optical depths are similar (0.018), and their spatial patterns correspond to those of reference data sets such as MACv2 and MACv2-SP despite a negative bias. Effective radiative forcings (ERFs) have been estimated using 30-year fixed sea surface temperature simulations (piClim) and several calls to the radiative scheme. Present-day anthropogenic aerosol ERF, aerosol-radiation ERF, and aerosol cloud ERF are fully within CMIP5 estimates and, respectively, equal to (Formula presented.) 1.10, (Formula presented.) 0.36, and (Formula presented.) 0.81 W m (Formula presented.) for CNRM-CM6-1 and (Formula presented.) 0.21, (Formula presented.) 0.61, and (Formula presented.) 0.74 W m (Formula presented.) for CNRM-ESM2-1. Additional CMIP6-type piClim simulations show that these differences are mainly due to the interactivity of the aerosol scheme whose impact is confirmed when assessing the response of both climate model configurations to rising CO (Formula presented.). Present-day stratospheric ozone ERF, equal to (Formula presented.) 0.04 W m (Formula presented.), is in agreement with that of the CMIP6 ozone. No trend appears in the ozone ERF over the historical period although the evolution of the total column ozone is correctly simulated.},

abstract = {LM3 is a new model of terrestrial water, energy, and carbon, intended for use in global hydrologic analyses and as a component of earth-system and physical-climate models. It is designed to improve upon the performance and to extend the scope of the predecessor Land Dynamics (LaD) and LM3V models by better quantifying the physical controls of climate and biogeochemistry and by relating more directly to components of the globalwater systemthat touch human concerns.LM3 includesmultilayer representations of temperature, liquid water content, and ice content of both snowpack andmacroporous soil-bedrock; topography-based description of saturated area and groundwater discharge and transport of runoff to the ocean via a global river and lake network. Sensible heat transport by watermass is accounted throughout for a complete energy balance. Carbon and vegetation dynamics and biophysics are represented as in LM3V. In numerical experiments, LM3 avoids some of the limitations of the LaD model and provides qualitatively (though not always quantitatively) reasonable estimates, from a global perspective, of observed spatial and/or temporal variations of vegetation density, albedo, streamflow, water-table depth, permafrost, and lake levels. Amplitude and phase of annual cycle of total water storage are simulated well. Realism of modeled lake levels varies widely. The water table tends to be consistently too shallow in humid regions. Biophysical properties have an artificial stepwise spatial structure, and equilibrium vegetation is sensitive to initial conditions. Explicit resolution of thick ({\textgreater}100m) unsaturated zones and permafrost is possible, but only at the cost of long (≫300 yr) model spinup times.},

abstract = {A new version of the atmospheric general circulation model of the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI), with a horizontal grid size of about 20 km, has been developed. The previous version of the 20-km model, MRIAGCM3.1, which was developed from an operational numerical weather-prediction model, provided information on possible climate change induced by global warming, including future changes in tropical cyclones, the East Asian monsoon, extreme events, and blockings. For the new version, MRI-AGCM3.2, we have introduced various new parameterization schemes that improve the model climate. Using the new model, we performed a present-day climate experiment using observed sea surface temperature. The model shows improvements in simulating heavy monthly-mean precipitation around the tropical Western Pacific, the global distribution of tropical cyclones, the seasonal march of East Asian summer monsoon, and blockings in the Pacific. Improvements in the model climatologies were confirmed numerically using skill scores (e.g., Taylor's skill score). {\textcopyright} 2012, Meteorological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {A rapid and accurate radiative transfer model (RRTM) for climate applications been developed and the results extensively evaluated. The current version of RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates for the longwave spectral region (10-3000 cm-1) for an arbitrary clear atmosphere. The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated-k method: the k distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line-by-line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high-resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated-k approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m-2 (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10-3000 cm-1) error of less than 1.0 W m-2 at any altitudes; 0.07 K d-1 for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d-1 in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m-2, an error of less than 5{\%}. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.},

abstract = {A new radiation package, "McRad," has become operational with cycle 32R2 of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). McRad includes an improved description of the land surface albedo from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) observations, the Monte Carlo independent column approximation treatment of the radiative transfer in clouds, and the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model shortwave scheme. The impact of McRad on year-long simulations at TL159L91 and higher-resolution 10-day forecasts is then documented. McRad is shown to benefit the representation of most parameters over both shorter and longer time scales, relative to the previous operational version of the radiative transfer schemes. At all resolutions, McRad improves the representation of the cloud-radiation interactions, particularly in the tropical regions, with improved temperature and wind objective scores through a reduction of some systematic errors in the position of tropical convection as a result of a change in the overall distribution of diabatic heating over the vertical plane, inducing a geographical redistribution of the centers of convection. Although smaller, the improvement is also seen in the rmse of geopotential in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and over Europe. Given the importance of cloudiness in modulating the radiative fluxes, the sensitivity of the model to cloud overlap assumption (COA) is also addressed, with emphasis on the flexibility that is inherent to this new RT approach when dealing with COA. The sensitivity of the forecasts to the space interpolation that is required to efficiently address the high computational cost of the RT parameterization is also revisited. A reduction of the radiation grid for the Ensemble Prediction System is shown to be of little impact on the scores while reducing the computational cost of the radiation computations. McRad is also shown to decrease the cold bias in ocean surface temperature in climate integrations with a coupled ocean system. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

Interpretation of these diagnostics requires detailed knowledge of the radiative, chemical, dynamical, and physical processes incorporated in the models. Also an understanding of the degree to which CCMI-1 recommendations for simulations have been followed is necessary to understand model responses to anthropogenic and natural forcing and also to explain intermodel differences. This becomes even more important given the ongoing development and the ever-growing complexity of these models.

Here, we apply control methods on ice surface velocities of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica to infer the spatial pattern of basal drag using a full-Stokes (FS) model of ice flow and compare the results obtained with two commonly-used simplified solutions: the MacAyeal shelfy stream model and the Blatter-Pattyn model. Over most of the model domain, the three models yield similar patterns of basal drag, yet near the glacier grounding-line, the simplified models yield high basal drag while FS yields almost no basal drag. The simplified models overestimate basal drag because they neglect bridging effects in an ice stream region of rapidly varying ice thickness. This result reinforces theoretical studies that a FS treatment of ice flow is essential near glacier grounding lines. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We document and evaluate the aerosol schemes as implemented in the physical and Earth system models, the Global Coupled 3.1 configuration of the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3 (HadGEM3-GC3.1) and the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1), which are contributing to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The simulation of aerosols in the present-day period of the historical ensemble of these models is evaluated against a range of observations. Updates to the aerosol microphysics scheme are documented as well as differences in the aerosol representation between the physical and Earth system configurations. The additional Earth system interactions included in UKESM1 lead to differences in the emissions of natural aerosol sources such as dimethyl sulfide, mineral dust and organic aerosol and subsequent evolution of these species in the model. UKESM1 also includes a stratospheric'tropospheric chemistry scheme which is fully coupled to the aerosol scheme, while GC3.1 employs a simplified aerosol chemistry mechanism driven by prescribed monthly climatologies of the relevant oxidants. Overall, the simulated speciated aerosol mass concentrations compare reasonably well with observations. Both models capture the negative trend in sulfate aerosol concentrations over Europe and the eastern United States of America (US) although the models tend to underestimate sulfate concentrations in both regions. Interactive emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds in UKESM1 lead to an improved agreement of organic aerosol over the US. Simulated dust burdens are similar in both models despite a 2-fold difference in dust emissions. Aerosol optical depth is biased low in dust source and outflow regions but performs well in other regions compared to a number of satellite and ground-based retrievals of aerosol optical depth. Simulated aerosol number concentrations are generally within a factor of 2 of the observations, with both models tending to overestimate number concentrations over remote ocean regions, apart from at high latitudes, and underestimate over Northern Hemisphere continents. Finally, a new primary marine organic aerosol source is implemented in UKESM1 for the first time. The impact of this new aerosol source is evaluated. Over the pristine Southern Ocean, it is found to improve the seasonal cycle of organic aerosol mass and cloud droplet number concentrations relative to GC3.1 although underestimations in cloud droplet number concentrations remain. This paper provides a useful characterisation of the aerosol climatology in both models and will facilitate understanding in the numerous aerosol' climate interaction studies that will be conducted as part of CMIP6 and beyond.},

This paper evaluates a coupled higher-resolution version (MPI-ESM1.2-HR) in comparison with its lower-resolved version (MPI-ESM1.2-LR). We focus on basic oceanic and atmospheric mean states and selected modes of variability, the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation. The increase in atmospheric resolution in MPI-ESM1.2-HR reduces the biases of upper-level zonal wind and atmospheric jet stream position in the northern extratropics. This results in a decrease of the storm track bias over the northern North Atlantic, for both winter and summer season. The blocking frequency over the European region is improved in summer, and North Atlantic Oscillation and related storm track variations improve in winter. Stable Atlantic meridional overturning circulations are found with magnitudes of {\~{}}16 Sv for MPI-ESM1.2-HR and {\~{}}20 Sv for MPI-ESM1.2-LR at 26°N. A strong sea surface temperature bias of {\~{}}5°C along with a too zonal North Atlantic current is present in both versions. The sea surface temperature bias in the eastern tropical Atlantic is reduced by {\~{}}1°C due to higher-resolved orography in MPI-ESM-HR, and the region of the cold-tongue bias is reduced in the tropical Pacific. MPI-ESM1.2-HR has a well-balanced radiation budget and its climate sensitivity is explicitly tuned to 3 K. Although the obtained reductions in long-standing biases are modest, the improvements in atmospheric dynamics make this model well suited for prediction and impact studies.},

abstract = {The present work aims at better understanding regional climate-aerosol interactions by studying the relationships between aerosols and synoptic atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Mediterranean region. Two 40-year simulations (1979-2018) have been carried out with version 6.3 of the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques (National Centre for Meteorological Research)-Aire Limite{\'{e}} Adaptation dynamique D{\'{e}}veloppement InterNational (CNRM-ALADIN) regional climate model, one using interactive aerosols and the other one without any aerosol. The simulation with aerosols has been evaluated in terms of different climate and aerosol parameters. This evaluation shows a good agreement between the model and observations, significant improvements compared to the previous model version and consequently the relevance of using this model for the study of climate-aerosol interactions over this region. A first attempt to explain the climate variability of aerosols is based on the use of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. The latter explains a significant part of the interannual variability, notably in winter for the export of dust aerosols over the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean, and in summer for the positive anomalies of anthropogenic aerosols over western Europe. This index is however not sufficient to fully understand the variations of aerosols in this region, notably at daily scale. The use of "weather regimes", namely persisting meteorological patterns, stable at synoptic scale for a few days, provides a relevant description of atmospheric circulation, which drives the emission, transport and deposition of aerosols. The four weather regimes usually defined in this area in winter and in summer bring significant information to answer this question. The blocking and NAOC regimes are largely favourable to strong aerosol effects on shortwave surface radiation and near-surface temperature, either because of higher aerosol loads or because of weaker cloud fraction, which reinforces the direct aerosol effect. Inversely, the NAO.. and Atlantic Ridge regimes are unfavourable to aerosol radiative effects, because of weaker aerosol concentrations and increased cloud cover. This study thus puts forward the strong dependence of aerosol loads on the synoptic circulation from interannual to daily scales and, as a consequence, the important modulation of the aerosol effects on shortwave surface radiation and near-surface temperature by atmospheric circulation. The role of cloud cover is essential in this modulation as shown by the use of weather regimes.},

abstract = {Using an ocean carbon cycle model embedded in an ocean general circulation model, we examine how the budget of anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) is controlled by ocean dynamics. To complement recent studies showing only vertically integrated budgets, we provide a step-by-step description by making use of three different coarse grainings of the full vertical resolution of the ocean model in our budget analysis. For the 11 subdomains of the global ocean, these coarse grainings are (1) a one-layer (vertically integrated) budget, (2) a three-layer budget, and (3) an 11-layer budget. We largely focus on the Pacific circulation. We identify and quantify substantial carbon transport associated with the subtropical cells (STCs), which are dominant contributors to the meridional overturning circulation in the upper ocean in the tropics and subtropics, as playing a fundamental role in governing the ocean interior distribution of Cant. The upper branch of the STCs transports Cant-rich water from the tropics to the subtropics, contributing to the precondition for the high Cant inventory in mode waters. The lower branch of the STCs carries about two thirds of the transported Cant back to the tropics, while it largely excludes Subtropical Mode Waters. This work implies that the reemergence of Cant through recirculation within the STCs may lead to a reduced capacity for further Cant uptake via gas exchange into the surface ocean, potentially contributing to a positive carbon-climate feedback.},

abstract = {The global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 (E63H23) as well as the previous model versions ECHAM5.5-HAM2.0 (E55H20) and ECHAM6.1-HAM2.2 (E61H22) are evaluated using global observational datasets for clouds and precipitation. In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM-HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated). There are indications that ICNCs are overestimated in E63H23. Since clouds are important for effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFariCaci) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), differences in ERFariCaci and ECS between the model versions were also analyzed. ERFariCaci is weaker in E63H23 (-1:0 W m-2) than in E61H22 (-1:2 W m-2) (or E55H20;-1:1 W m-2). This is caused by the weaker shortwave ERFariCaci (a new aerosol activation scheme and sea salt emission parameterization in E63H23, more realistic simulation of cloud water) overcompensating for the weaker longwave ERFariCaci (removal of an inconsistency in ICNC in cirrus clouds in E61H22). The decrease in ECS in E63H23 (2.5 K) compared to E61H22 (2.8 K) is due to changes in the entrainment rate for shallow convection (affecting the cloud amount feedback) and a stronger cloud phase feedback. Experiments with minimum cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCmin) of 40 cm-3 or 10 cm-3 show that a higher value of CDNCmin reduces ERFariCaci as well as ECS in E63H23.},

@article{Nitta2017,
abstract = {Wetlands cover large areas of the middle and high latitudes and influence the surface water and energy budget, surface hydrology, and the climate system. In this study, a scheme implicitly representing a snow-fed wetland, in which snowmelt can be stored with consideration of subgrid terrain complexity, was implemented in the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) land surface model. An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiment was conducted using the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5), with and without the wetland scheme, with the main aim of reducing the model bias of warm and dry boreal summer at mid- to high latitudes. The experiment showed not only a better surface hydrology but also a weaker land-atmosphere coupling strength and larger (smaller) latent (sensible) heat flux due to the delayed snowmelt runoff. The summer warm and dry bias was partially improved over snowy and flat areas, particularly over much of western Eurasia and North America, without an apparent deterioration of simulated surface hydrology and climate over the rest of the land in the other seasons; the mean absolute error of 2-m air temperature and precipitation over land at 45°-90°N in summer decreased by 19{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. The next step of model development will involve implementing an explicit representation of subgrid-scale surface water and related processes.},

abstract = {Subgrid snow cover is one of the key parameters in global land models since snow cover has large impacts on the surface energy and moisture budgets, and hence the surface temperature. In this study, the Subgrid Snow Distribution (SSNOWD) snow cover parameterization was incorporated into the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) land surface model. SSNOWD assumes that the subgrid snow water equivalent (SWE) distribution follows a lognormal distribution function, and its parameters are physically derived from geoclimatic information. Two 29-yr global offline simulations, with and without SSNOWD, were performed while forced with the Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis (JRA-25) dataset combined with an observed precipitation dataset. The simulated spatial patterns of mean monthly snow cover fraction were compared with satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The snow cover fraction was improved by the inclusion of SSNOWD, particularly for the accumulation season and/or regions with relatively small amounts of snowfall; snow cover fraction was typically underestimated in the simulation without SSNOWD. In the Northern Hemisphere, the daily snow-covered area was validated using Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow analysis datasets.In the simulation with SSNOWD, snow-covered area largely agreed with the IMS snow analysis and the seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere was improved. This was because SSNOWD formulates the snow cover fraction differently for the accumulation season and ablation season, and represents the hysteresis of the snow cover fraction between different seasons. The effects of including SSNOWD on hydrological properties and snow mass were also examined. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This first paper of the two-part series describes the objectives of the community efforts in improving the Noah land surface model (LSM), documents, through mathematical formulations, the augmented conceptual realism in biophysical and hydrological processes, and introduces a framework for multiple options to parameterize selected processes (Noah-MP). The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.

abstract = {We describe the evolution of Arctic sea ice as modeled by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology's Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). The modeled spatial distribution and interannual variability of the sea-ice cover agree well with satellite observations and are improved relative to the model's predecessor ECHAM5/MPIOM. An evaluation of modeled sea-ice coverage based on sea-ice area gives, however, conflicting results compared to an evaluation based on sea-ice extent and is additionally hindered by uncertainties in the observational record. Simulated trends in sea-ice coverage for the satellite period range from more strongly negative than observed to positive. The observed evolution of Arctic sea ice is incompatible with modeled internal variability and probably caused by external forcing. Simulated drift patterns agree well with observations, but simulated drift speed is generally too high. Simulated sea-ice volume agrees well with volume estimates of the PIOMAS reanalysis for the past few years. However, a preceding Arctic wide decrease in sea-ice volume starts much earlier in MPI-ESM than in PIOMAS. Analyzing this behavior in MPI-ESM's ocean model MPIOM, we find that the modeled volume trend depends crucially on the specific choice of atmospheric reanalysis forcing, which casts some doubt on the reliability of estimates of volume trends. In our CMIP5 scenario simulations, we find a substantial delay in sea-ice response to increasing CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentration; a seasonally ice-free Arctic can result for a CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentration of around 500 ppm. Simulated winter sea-ice coverage drops rapidly to near ice-free conditions once the mean Arctic winter temperature exceeds -5°C. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017-2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018-2020 period.},

abstract = {Decadal-time-scale responses of climate and the global carbon cycle towarming associated with rapid increases in atmospheric methane from a massive methane release from marine sedimentary methane hydrates are investigated with a coupled climate-carbon cycle model.A 1000-fold methane increase (from{\textless}1 to 1000 ppmv) causes surface air temperatures to increase with a global warming of {\textgreater}6°C within 80 yr. The amount of carbon stored in the land biosphere decreases by {\textgreater}25{\%}. This is mostly due to a large decrease in tropical net primary production during the first few years ({\~{}}-40{\%}), which is caused by a decrease in photosynthesis and an increase in plant maintenance respiration with the early warming of {\~{}}3°C, leading to tropical forest dieback ({\textgreater}20{\%}) and the largest decrease in vegetation carbon of {\textgreater}50{\%} ({\textgreater}80{\%} of the decrease in global vegetation carbon). The decrease in global land carbon is also partly due to forestdiebacks (mainly boreal forest dieback by heat stress) at northern middle latitudes. In contrast, vegetation increases by{\textgreater}50{\%} at northern high latitudes because of the amelioration to warm and wet conditions. Sensitivity experiments show that the warming of{\textgreater}6°C consists mainly of{\textgreater}5°C by the 1000-fold atmospheric methane and an additionalincrease of 1°C by the atmospheric CO2 increase due to the land CO2 release and that the CO2 fertilization of land plants prevents further warming of 1°C by limiting the atmospheric CO2 increase. The large decrease in land biomass estimated in this study suggests a critical situation for the land ecosystem or agricultural production, especially in the tropics. Because global methane content of marine methane hydrates is estimated at {\~{}}10 000 Gt, more intense warming leading to greater damage to the land biomass than the authors' experiment ({\~{}}2000 Gt) is possible in the future methane release event that would be caused by the ongoing anthropogenic warming. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {We used the Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model to simulate the climate response to massive sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission from the volcanic eruptions of Paektusan (China/North Korea) and Eldgj{\'{a}} (Iceland) into the stratosphere in the tenth century Common Era (CE). Assuming 3 times the SO2 emission of the 1883 Krakatau eruption, as recorded by Greenland ice core sulfate concentrations, simulations of Paektusan and Eldgj{\'{a}} had roughly similar global mean impacts within 2 years of erupting: decreases in surface insolation (−10 W/m2, −5{\%}), surface air temperature (−1 °C), land net primary production (NPP; −3 GtC/year, −5{\%}), and soil respiration (−5 GtC/year, −10{\%}). While both simulations had severe impacts on the extratropical Northern Hemisphere, the simulated response to Paektusan is twice as strong as Eldgj{\'{a}} in the tropics (cooling [1 °C], precipitation decrease [10{\%}], and NPP increase [7{\%}]). Simulation-Eldgj{\'{a}} had almost no impact on the extratropical Southern Hemisphere because of its initial latitude. These regional differences combine so that Simulation-Paektusan has slightly larger global mean impacts, including an atmospheric CO2 decrease of {\~{}}2 ppm. Tropical NPP primarily increases due to the fact that photosynthesis maximizes at temperatures below the tropical mean temperature and secondarily to the cooling-induced decrease in respiration, which indicates relatively rich tropical harvests despite large volcanic eruptions. In contrast, the severe cooling (−2.5 °C) and decreased NPP (−20{\%}) in the northern extratropics could mean poor harvests and famines, which can lead to social turmoil such as a rebellion in northeast Japan around the same time as the eruptions.},

abstract = {As a first step toward designing a comprehensive model for validating land surface hydrology and river flow in Earth system models, a global river channel network has been prepared at 1 latitude 1 longitude resolution. The end product is the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) network. The aim of TRIP is to provide information of lateral water movement over land following the paths of river channels. Flow directions were determined from vector data of river channels and river pathways available in two recent atlases; however, an automatic procedure using a digital elevation map of the corresponding horizontal resolution was used as a first guess. In this way, a template to convert the river discharge data into mean runoff per unit area of the basin has been obtained. One hundred eighty major rivers are identified and adequately resolved; they cover 63{\%} of land, excluding Ant-arctica and Greenland. Most of the river basin sizes are well within a 20{\%} difference of published values, with a root-mean-square error of approximately 10{\%}. Furthermore, drainage areas for more than 400 gauging stations were delineated. Obviously, the stream lengths in TRIP are shorter than the natural lengths published as data. This is caused by the meandering of rivers in the Page 2 real world. Meandering ratio (r M), the ratio of actual (published) river length to the idealized river length, has been calculated. Averaged globally for all available data, r M is 1.4, although it is 1.3 for rivers with areas larger than 500,000 km 2. The r M data will be useful in the design of the Scheme for Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (STRIP). In the current form, TRIP can be used as a template for producing a time series of river flow using a simple version of STRIP.},

abstract = {The effective radiative forcing (ERF) of anthropogenic gases and aerosols under present-day conditions relative to preindustrial conditions is estimated using the Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model version 2.0 (MRI-ESM2.0) as part of the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) and Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP), endorsed by the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The global mean total anthropogenic net ERF estimate at the top of the atmosphere is 1.96 W m−2 and is composed primarily of positive forcings due to carbon dioxide (1.85 W m−2), methane (0.71 W m−2), and halocarbons (0.30 W m−2) and negative forcing due to the total aerosols (− 1.22 W m−2). The total aerosol ERF consists of 23{\%} from aerosol-radiation interactions (− 0.32 W m−2), 71{\%} from aerosol-cloud interactions (− 0.98 W m−2), and slightly from surface albedo changes caused by aerosols (0.08 W m−2). The ERFs due to aerosol-radiation interactions consist of opposing contributions from light-absorbing black carbon (BC) (0.25 W m−2) and from light-scattering sulfate (− 0.48 W m−2) and organic aerosols (− 0.07 W m−2) and are pronounced over emission source regions. The ERFs due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci) are prominent over the source and downwind regions, caused by increases in the number concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplets in low-level clouds. Concurrently, increases in the number concentration of ice crystals in high-level clouds (temperatures {\textless} –38 °C), primarily induced by anthropogenic BC aerosols, particularly over tropical convective regions, cause both substantial negative shortwave and positive longwave ERFaci values in MRI-ESM2.0. These distinct forcings largely cancel each other; however, significant longwave radiative heating of the atmosphere caused by high-level ice clouds suggests the importance of further studies on the interactions of aerosols with ice clouds. Total anthropogenic net ERFs are almost entirely positive over the Arctic due to contributions from the surface albedo reductions caused by BC. In the Arctic, BC provides the second largest contribution to the positive ERFs after carbon dioxide, suggesting a possible important role of BC in Arctic surface warming.

In order to investigate the projected changes in near future climate conditions, the Regional Climate Model, RegCM4.3.5 of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) was driven by two different CMIP5 global climate models. The HadGEM2-ES global climate model of the Met Office Hadley Centre and the MPI-ESM-MR global climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology were downscaled to 50 km for the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Region 8. We investigated the seasonal time-scale performance of RegCM4.3.5 in reproducing observed climatology over the domain of the Central Asia by using two different global climate model outputs. For the future climatology of the domain, the regional model projects relatively high warming in the warm season with a decrease in precipitation in almost all parts of the domain. A warming trend is notable, especially for the northern part of the domain during the cold season. The results of our study show that surface air temperatures in the region will increase between 3 °C and about 7 °C on average, according to the emission scenarios for the period of 2071–2100 with respect to past period of 1971–2000. Therefore, the projected warming and decrease in precipitation might adversely affect the ecological and socio-economic systems of this region, which is already a mostly arid and semi-arid environment.},

HadGEM2-ES global climate model of the Met Office Hadley Centre and MPI-ESM-MR global climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology were used to generate 50 km resolution data for the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Region 13. We test the seasonal time-scale performance of RegCM4.4 in simulating the observed climatology over domain of the MENA by using the output of two different global climate models. The projection results show relatively high increase of average temperatures from 3 °C up to 9 °C over the domain for far future (2070–2100). A strong decrease in precipitation is projected in almost all parts of the domain according to the output of the regional model forced by scenario outputs of two global models. Therefore, warmer and drier than present climate conditions are projected to occur more intensely over the CORDEX-MENA domain.},

abstract = {We document the performance of a new earth system model developed at Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, called the KIOST-ESM, based on a low-resolution ({\~{}} 200 km for the atmosphere, {\~{}} 100 km for the ocean) version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model 2.5. The main changes made to the base model include adopting a unified convection scheme for cumulus convection and an ocean mixed layer parameterization considering Langmuir circulation, which improve the model fidelity significantly. In addition, the KIOST-ESM adopts a new soil respiration scheme in the dynamic vegetation process of its land component. The performance of the KIOST-ESM was assessed in pre-industrial and historical simulations that are made as part of its participation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The response of the earth system to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations was analyzed in the ScenarioMIP simulations. An abrupt quadrupling of CO2 experiment suggests that the equilibrium climate sensitivity of KIOST-ESM is 3.36 K—very close to the averaged one obtained from CMIP5 simulations. Although the KIOST-ESM showed a notable cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere and the double Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone bias, the KIOST-ESM outperforms the base model in simulating the mean sea surface temperature over the Southern Ocean and over the cold tongue in the tropical Pacific. The KIOST-ESM can also simulate the dominant tropical variability in intraseasonal (Madden–Julian Oscillation) and interannual (El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation) timescales more realistically.},

The Earth Systems Physics (ESP) group of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) maintains and distributes a state-of-the-science regional climate model called the ICTP Regional Climate Model version 3 (RegCM3), which is currently being used by a large research community for a diverse range of climate-related studies. The RegCM3 is the central, but not only, tool of the ICTP-maintained Regional Climate Research Network (RegCNET) aimed at creating south-south and north-south scientific interactions on the topic of climate and associated impacts research and modeling. In this paper, RegCNET, RegCM3, and illustrative results from RegCM3 benchmark simulations applied over south Asia, Africa, and South America are presented. It is shown that RegCM3 performs reasonably well over these regions and is therefore useful for climate studies in EDNs. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {We present the results of the application of the COSMO-CLM Regional Climate Model (CCLM) over the CORDEX-Africa domain. Two simulations were performed driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1989-2008): the first one with the standard CORDEX spatial resolution (0.44°), and the second one with an unprecedented high resolution (0.22°). Low-level circulation and its vertical structure, the geographical and temporal evolution of temperature and precipitation are critically evaluated, together with the radiation budget and surface energy fluxes. CCLM is generally able to reproduce the overall features of the African climate, although some deficiencies are evident. Flow circulation is generally well simulated, but an excessive pressure gradient is present between the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahara, related to a marked warm bias over the Sahara and a cold bias over southern Sahel. CCLM underestimates the rainfall peak in the regions affected by the passage of the monsoon. This dry bias may be a consequence of two factors, the misplacement of the monsoon centre and the underestimation of its intensity. The former is related to the northern shift of the West African Heat Low. On the other hand, the underestimation of precipitation intensity may be related to the underestimation of the surface short-wave radiation and latent heat flux. The increase of the model resolution does not bring evident improvements to the results for monthly means statistics. As a result, it appears that 0.44° is a suitable compromise between model performances and computational constrains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {As a contribution to phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the global climate simulated by an atmospheric general circulationmodel (GCM), the Seoul NationalUniversityAtmosphere Model version 0 with a Unified Convection Scheme (SAM0-UNICON), is compared with observation and climates simulated by the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) and Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), on which SAM0-UNICON is based. Both SAM0-UNICON and CESM1 successfully reproduce observed global warming after 1970. The global mean climate simulated by SAM0-UNICON is roughly similar to that of CAM5/CESM1. However, SAM0-UNICON improves the simulations of the double intertropical convergence zone, shortwave cloud forcing, near-surface air temperature, aerosol optical depth, sea ice fraction, and sea surface temperature (SST), but is slightly poorer for the simulation of tropical relative humidity, Pacific surface wind stress, and ocean rainfall. Two important biases in the simulated mean climate in both models are a set of horseshoe-shaped biases of SST, sea level pressure, precipitation, and cloud radiative forcings in the central equatorial Pacific and a higher sea ice fraction in the Arctic periphery and Southern Hemispheric circumpolar regions. Both SAM0- UNICON and CESM1 simulate the observed El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) reasonably well. However, compared with CAM5/CESM1, SAM0-UNICON performs better in simulating the Madden- Julian oscillation (MJO), diurnal cycle of precipitation, and tropical cyclones. The aerosol indirect effect (AIE) simulated by SAM0-UNICON is similar to that from CAM5 but the magnitudes of the individual shortwave and longwave AIEs are substantially reduced.},

abstract = {Numerical simulation, and in particular simulation of the earth system, relies on contributions from diverse communities, from those who develop models to those involved in devising, executing, and analysing numerical experiments. Often these people work in different institutions and may be working with significant separation in time (particularly analysts, who may be working on data produced years earlier), and they typically communicate via published information (whether journal papers, technical notes, or websites). The complexity of the models, experiments, and methodologies, along with the diversity (and sometimes inexact nature) of information sources, can easily lead to misinterpretation of what was actually intended or done. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of terms for more clearly defining numerical experiments, put it in the context of previous work on experimental ontologies, and describe how we have used it to document the experiments of the sixth phase for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We describe how, through iteration with a range of CMIP6 stakeholders, we rationalized multiple sources of information and improved the clarity of experimental definitions. We demonstrate how this process has added value to CMIP6 itself by (a) helping those devising experiments to be clear about their goals and their implementation, (b) making it easier for those executing experiments to know what is intended, (c) exposing interrelationships between experiments, and (d) making it clearer for third parties (data users) to understand the CMIP6 experiments. We conclude with some lessons learnt and how these may be applied to future CMIP phases as well as other modelling campaigns.},

abstract = {The magnitude of the Antarctic ice sheet's contribution to global sea-level rise is dominated by the potential of its marine sectors to become unstable and collapse as a response to ocean (and atmospheric) forcing. This paper presents Antarctic sea-level response to sudden atmospheric and oceanic forcings on multi-centennial timescales with the newly developed fast Elementary Thermomechanical Ice Sheet (f.ETISh) model. The f.ETISh model is a vertically integrated hybrid ice sheet-ice shelf model with vertically integrated thermomechanical coupling, making the model two-dimensional. Its marine boundary is represented by two different flux conditions, coherent with power-law basal sliding and Coulomb basal friction. The model has been compared to existing benchmarks. Modelled Antarctic ice sheet response to forcing is dominated by sub-ice shelf melt and the sensitivity is highly dependent on basal conditions at the grounding line. Coulomb friction in the grounding-line transition zone leads to significantly higher mass loss in both West and East Antarctica on centennial timescales, leading to 1.5 m sea-level rise after 500 years for a limited melt scenario of 10 m ag-1 under freely floating ice shelves, up to 6 m for a 50 m ag-1 scenario. The higher sensitivity is attributed to higher ice fluxes at the grounding line due to vanishing effective pressure. Removing the ice shelves altogether results in a disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and (partially) marine basins in East Antarctica. After 500 years, this leads to a 5 m and a 16 m sea-level rise for the power-law basal sliding and Coulomb friction conditions at the grounding line, respectively. The latter value agrees with simulations by DeConto and Pollard (2016) over a similar period (but with different forcing and including processes of hydrofracturing and cliff failure). The chosen parametrizations make model results largely independent of spatial resolution so that f.ETISh can potentially be integrated in large-scale Earth system models.},

abstract = {The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is a new coupled Earth system model sponsored by the U.S Department of Energy. Here we present E3SM global simulations using active ocean and sea ice that are driven by the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments II (CORE-II) interannual atmospheric forcing data set. The E3SM ocean and sea ice components are MPAS-Ocean and MPAS-Seaice, which use the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) framework and run on unstructured horizontal meshes. For this study, grid cells vary from 30 to 60 km for the low-resolution mesh and 6 to 18 km at high resolution. The vertical grid is a structured z-star coordinate and uses 60 and 80 layers for low and high resolution, respectively. The lower-resolution simulation was run for five CORE cycles (310 years) with little drift in sea surface temperature (SST) or heat content. The meridional heat transport (MHT) is within observational range, while the meridional overturning circulation at 26.5°N is low compared to observations. The largest temperature biases occur in the Labrador Sea and western boundary currents (WBCs), and the mixed layer is deeper than observations at northern high latitudes in the winter months. In the Antarctic, maximum mixed layer depths (MLD) compare well with observations, but the spatial MLD pattern is shifted relative to observations. Sea ice extent, volume, and concentration agree well with observations. At high resolution, the sea surface height compares well with satellite observations in mean and variability.},

The ESGF is a network of internationally distributed sites that together work as a federated data archive. Data records from climate modelling institutes are published to the ESGF and then shared around the world. It is anticipated that CMIP6 will produce approximately 20 PB of data to be published and distributed via the ESGF. In addition to this large volume of data a number of value-added CMIP6 services are required to interact with the ESGF; for example the citation and errata services both interact with the ESGF but are not a core part of its infrastructure. With a number of interacting services and a large volume of data anticipated for CMIP6, the CMIP Data Node Operations Team (CDNOT) was formed. The CDNOT coordinated and implemented a series of CMIP6 preparation data challenges to test all the interacting components in the ESGF CMIP6 software ecosystem. This ensured that when CMIP6 data were released they could be reliably distributed.},

It uses a hybrid combination of the scaled shallow ice and shallow shelf approximations for ice flow. Floating ice shelves and grounding-line migration are included, with parameterized ice fluxes at grounding lines that allows relatively coarse resolutions to be used. All significant components and parameterizations of the model are described in some detail. Basic results for modern Antarctica are compared with observations, and simulations over the last 5 million years are compared with previously published results.

abstract = {Geological data indicate that global mean sea level has fluctuated on 103 to 106 yr time scales during the last {\~{}}25 million years, at times reaching 20 m or more above modern. If correct, this implies substantial variations in the size of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). However, most climate and ice sheet models have not been able to simulate significant EAIS retreat from continental size, given that atmospheric CO2 levels were relatively low throughout this period. Here, we use a continental ice sheet model to show that mechanisms based on recent observations and analysis have the potential to resolve this model-data conflict. In response to atmospheric and ocean temperatures typical of past warm periods, floating ice shelves may be drastically reduced or removed completely by increased oceanic melting, and by hydrofracturing due to surface melt draining into crevasses. Ice at deep grounding lines may be weakened by hydrofracturing and reduced buttressing, and may fail structurally if stresses exceed the ice yield strength, producing rapid retreat. Incorporating these mechanisms in our ice-sheet model accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to decadal time scales, and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial basins, producing {\~{}}17 m global sea-level rise within a few thousand years. The mechanisms are highly parameterized and should be tested by further process studies. But if accurate, they offer one explanation for past sea-level high stands, and suggest that Antarctica may be more vulnerable to warm climates than in most previous studies.},

abstract = {The critical role of oceanic surface waves in climate system is attracting more and more attention. We set up an Earth System Model, which is named as the First Institute of Oceanography-Earth System Model (FIO-ESM), composed of a coupled physical climate model and a coupled carbon cycle model. A surface wave model is introduced through including the nonbreaking wave-induced vertical mixing, which can improve the performance of climate model especially in the simulation of upper ocean mixed layer depth in the southern ocean, into the ocean general circulation model. The FIO-ESM is employed to conduct Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments. The historical simulation of FIO-ESM's physical climate model for 1850-2005 shows that the simulated patterns of surface air temperature (SAT), rainfall, and El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) match those of the observations. Future projections under the four scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 are also conducted and the global averaged SAT in 2100 would be -0.007°C, 1.10°C, 1.85°C, and 3.92°C higher than that in 2005, respectively. The historical simulation and future projection under RCP8.5 with global carbon cycle show the SAT and atmospheric CO2 concentration are well reproduced in the historical period and the global averaged SAT would increase by 3.90°C in 2100, which is quite similar to the physical climate model's result. Further analysis shows surface wave makes projected SAT in RCP2.6 about 2°C cooler in the Arctic area and 2°C warmer in the southern ocean. {\textcopyright} 2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {In this paper, we present the GRISLI (Grenoble ice sheet and land ice) model in its newest revision (version 2.0). Whilst GRISLI is applicable to any given ice sheet, we focus here on the Antarctic ice sheet because it highlights the importance of grounding line dynamics. Important improvements have been implemented in the model since its original version (Ritz et al., 2001). Notably, GRISLI now includes a basal hydrology model and an explicit flux computation at the grounding line based on the analytical formulations of Schoof (2007) or Tsai et al. (2015). We perform a full calibration of the model based on an ensemble of 300 simulations sampling mechanical parameter space using a Latin hypercube method. Performance of individual members is assessed relative to the deviation from present-day observed Antarctic ice thickness. To assess the ability of the model to simulate grounding line migration, we also present glacial-interglacial ice sheet changes throughout the last 400{\&}thinsp;kyr using the best ensemble members taking advantage of the capacity of the model to perform multi-millennial long-term integrations. To achieve this goal, we construct a simple climatic perturbation of present-day climate forcing fields based on two climate proxies: atmospheric and oceanic. The model is able to reproduce expected grounding line advances during glacial periods and subsequent retreats during terminations with reasonable glacial-interglacial ice volume changes.},

abstract = {A large component of present-day sea-level rise is due to the melt of glaciers other than the ice sheets. Recent projections of their contribution to global sea-level rise for the twenty-first century range between 70 and 180 mm, but bear significant uncertainty due to poor glacier inventory and lack of hypsometric data. Here, we aim to update the projections and improve quantification of their uncertainties by using a recently released global inventory containing outlines of almost every glacier in the world. We model volume change for each glacier in response to transient spatially-differentiated temperature and precipitation projections from 14 global climate models with two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) prepared for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The multi-model mean suggests sea-level rise of 155 ± 41 mm (RCP4.5) and 216 ± 44 mm (RCP8.5) over the period 2006-2100, reducing the current global glacier volume by 29 or 41 {\%}. The largest contributors to projected global volume loss are the glaciers in the Canadian and Russian Arctic, Alaska, and glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Although small contributors to global volume loss, glaciers in Central Europe, low-latitude South America, Caucasus, North Asia, and Western Canada and US are projected to lose more than 80 {\%} of their volume by 2100. However, large uncertainties in the projections remain due to the choice of global climate model and emission scenario. With a series of sensitivity tests we quantify additional uncertainties due to the calibration of our model with sparsely observed glacier mass changes. This gives an upper bound for the uncertainty range of ±84 mm sea-level rise by 2100 for each projection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 1, the atmospheric component of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model is described. The model began as a fork of the well-known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km ({\~{}}0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to “brute force” tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution. A brief overview of the model and model climate is provided. Model fidelity has generally improved compared to its predecessors and the CMIP5 generation of climate models.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop an advanced parameterization of the snow-free land surface albedo for climate modelling describing the temporal variation of surface albedo as a function of vegetation phenology on a monthly time scale. To estimate the effect of vegetation phenology on snow-free land surface albedo, remotely sensed data products from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the NASA Terra platform measured during 2001 to 2004 are used. The snow-free surface albedo variability is determined by the optical contrast between the vegetation canopy and the underlying soil surface. The MODIS products of the white-sky albedo for total shortwave broad bands and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) are analysed to separate the vegetation canopy albedo from the underlying soil albedo. Global maps of pure soil albedo and pure vegetation albedo are derived on a 0.5° regular latitude/longitude grid, re-sampling the high-resolution information from remote sensing-measured pixel level to the model grid scale and filling up gaps from the satellite data. These global maps show that in the northern and mid-latitudes soils are mostly darker than vegetation, whereas in the lower latitudes, especially in semi-deserts, soil albedo is mostly higher than vegetation albedo. The separated soil and vegetation albedo can be applied to compute the annual surface albedo cycle from monthly varying leaf area index. This parameterization is especially designed for the land surface scheme of the regional climate model REMO and the global climate model ECHAM5, but can easily be integrated into the land surface schemes of other regional and global climate models. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2008.},

abstract = {We introduce a new climate model (GISS E2.2) that has been specially optimized for the middle atmosphere and whose output is being contributed to the CMIP6 archive. The top of the model is at a geopotential altitude of 89 km, and parameterizations of moist convection and various forms of gravity wave drag based on tropospheric processes are chosen specifically for this optimization. We first evaluate the model in its configuration as a coupled atmosphere-chemistry model with respect to its simulation of the mean state of the middle atmosphere, from the mesosphere down through the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. Then we assess its use as a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model by exploring its mean ocean climatology. To evaluate its variability, we report on its simulation of the primary modes in the troposphere, stratosphere, and ocean. Two climate change simulations are presented, the responses to instantaneous increases of 2xCO2 and 4xCO2, run with two different ocean models. Sensitivity studies are performed to illustrate the effect of parameterizations on the model results. We compare these results to the lower vertical resolution/top GISS Model E2.1, whose output has also been submitted to CMIP6. The different choices made for these models are explored. It is shown that important improvements in the circulation above and below the tropopause can be obtained when attention is paid to representation of middle atmosphere processes in climate model development.},

abstract = {This paper presents atmosphere-only and coupled climate model configurations of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS) for different combinations of ocean and atmosphere resolution. These configurations are used to perform multi-decadal ensemble experiments following the protocols of the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) and phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are used to evaluate the sensitivity of major biases in the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere to changes in atmosphere and ocean resolution. All configurations successfully reproduce the observed long-Term trends in global mean surface temperature. Furthermore, following an adjustment to account for {\textless}q{\textgreater}drift{\textless}/q{\textgreater} in the subsurface ocean, coupled configurations of ECMWF-IFS realistically reproduce observation-based estimates of ocean heat content change since 1950. Climatological surface biases in ECMWF-IFS are relatively insensitive to an increase in atmospheric resolution from ĝ1/4 50 to ĝ1/4 25{\&}thinsp;km. However, increasing the horizontal resolution of the atmosphere while maintaining the same vertical resolution enhances the magnitude of a cold bias in the lower stratosphere. In coupled configurations, there is a strong sensitivity to an increase in ocean model resolution from 1 to 0.25°. However, this sensitivity to ocean resolution takes many years to fully manifest and is less apparent in the first year of integration. This result has implications for the ECMWF coupled model development strategy that typically relies on the analysis of biases in short ( {\textless} 1 year) ensemble (re)forecast data sets. The impacts of increased ocean resolution are particularly evident in the North Atlantic and Arctic, where they are associated with an improved Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, increased meridional ocean heat transport, and more realistic sea-ice cover. In the tropical Pacific, increased ocean resolution is associated with improvements to the magnitude and asymmetry of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability and better representation of non-linear sea surface temperature (SST)-radiation feedbacks during warm events. However, increased ocean model resolution also increases the magnitude of a warm bias in the Southern Ocean. Finally, there is tentative evidence that both ocean coupling and increased atmospheric resolution can improve teleconnections between tropical Pacific rainfall and geopotential height anomalies in the North Atlantic.},

abstract = {The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) HighResMIP is a new experimental design for global climate model simulations that aims to assess the impact of model horizontal resolution on climate simulation fidelity.We describe a hierarchy of global coupled model resolutions based on the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model 3-Global Coupled vn 3.1 (HadGEM3-GC3.1) model that ranges from an atmosphere-ocean resolution of 130 km-1° to 25 km-1=12°, all using the same forcings and initial conditions. In order to make such high-resolution simulations possible, the experiments have a short 30-year spinup, followed by at least century-long simulations with constant forcing to assess drift. We assess the change in model biases as a function of both atmosphere and ocean resolution, together with the effectiveness and robustness of this new experimental design.We find reductions in the biases in top-of-atmosphere radiation components and cloud forcing. There are significant reductions in some common surface climate model biases as resolution is increased, particularly in the Atlantic for sea surface temperature and precipitation, primarily driven by increased ocean resolution. There is also a reduction in drift from the initial conditions both at the surface and in the deeper ocean at higher resolution. Using an eddy-present and eddy-rich ocean resolution enhances the strength of the North Atlantic ocean circulation (boundary currents, overturning circulation and heat transport), while an eddy-present ocean resolution has a considerably reduced Antarctic Circumpolar Current strength. All models have a reasonable representation of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation. In general, the biases present after 30 years of simulations do not change character markedly over longer timescales, justifying the experimental design.},

ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is now coupled to the new version (8.0) of the SURFace EXternalis{\'{e}}e (SURFEX) surface model, in which several new features (e.g., floodplains, aquifers, and snow processes) improve the water cycle realism. The model calibration is discussed in depth. An amip-type experiment, in which the sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations are prescribed, and following the CMIP6 protocol, is extensively evaluated, in terms of climate mean state and variability. ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is shown to improve over its previous version (5.1) by many climate features. Major improvements include the top-of-atmosphere and surface energy budgets in their various components (shortwave and longwave, total and clear sky), cloud cover, near-surface temperature, precipitation climatology and daily-mean distribution, and water discharges at the outlet of major rivers. In contrast, clouds over subtropical stratocumulus decks, several dynamical variables (sea level pressure, 500-hPa geopotential height), are still significantly biased. The tropical intraseasonal variability and diurnal cycle of precipitation, though improved, remained area of concerns for further model improvement. New biases also emerge, such as a lack of precipitation over several tropical continental areas. Within the CMIP6 context, ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is the atmospheric component of CNRM-CM6-1 and CNRM-ESM2-1.},

The coupled CAMS-CSM consists of the modified atmospheric model [ECmwf-HAMburg (ECHAM5)], ocean model [Modular Ocean Model (MOM4)], sea ice model [Sea Ice Simulator (SIS)], and land surface model [Common Land Model (CoLM)]. A detailed model description is presented and both the pre-industrial and “historical” simulations are preliminarily evaluated in this study. The model can reproduce the climatological mean states and seasonal cycles of the major climate system quantities, including the sea surface temperature, precipitation, sea ice extent, and the equatorial thermocline. The major climate variability modes are also reasonably captured by the CAMS-CSM, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The model shows a promising ability to simulate the EASM variability and the ENSO–EASM relationship. Some biases still exist, such as the false double-intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the annual mean precipitation field, the overestimated ENSO amplitude, and the weakened Bjerknes feedback associated with ENSO; and thus the CAMS-CSM needs further improvements.},

abstract = {The treatment of the sulfur cycle in the CSIRO global climate model (GCM) is described. It is substantially based on the scheme developed previously for me EuropeanCenter/Hamburg (ECHAM) model, but the treatment of wet scavenging has been completely rewritten to better reflect the different properties of liquid and frozen precipitation, and the treatment of these in the model's cloud microphysical scheme. The model is able to reproduce the observed finding that wet deposition of sulfur over Europe and North America is larger in summer than in winter, but the seasonal cycle of sulfate over Europe is not well simulated. The latter is improved when the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of European emissions is increased. Below-cloud scavenging makes an important contribution in our scheme: On omitting it, the global sulfate burden increases from 0.67 to 0.93 Tg S. On reverting to the less efficient scavenging treatment used in ECHAM, the global sulfate burden again increases from 0.67 to 0.93 Tg S, and excessive sulfate concentrations are obtained in Europe and North America. Some deficiencies in the simulation are investigated via further sensitivity tests. In particular, during the Arctic winter, the modeled sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations are too large, and the modeled sulfate concentrations are too small (as in most global sulfur-cycle models). Recent laboratory experiments suggest that SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} oxidation in ice clouds is nonnegligible. We obtain a much improved Arctic simulation when a simple treatment ot SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} oxidation in ice clouds is included.

abstract = {Australian dust emissions are highly episodic, and this may increase the importance of Australian dust as a climate feedback agent. We compare two 160-year coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations of modern-day climate using the CSIRO Mark 3.6 global climate model (GCM). The first run (DUST) includes an interactive treatment of mineral dust and its direct radiative effects. The second run (NODUST) is otherwise identical, but has the Australian dust source set to zero. We focus on the austral spring season, when the correlation between rainfall and the El Ni±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is strongest over Australia. The ENSO-rainfall relationship over eastern Australia is stronger in the DUST run: dry (El Ni±o) years tend to be drier, and wet (La Ni±a) years wetter. The amplification of ENSO-related rainfall variability over eastern Australia represents an improvement relative to observations. The effect is driven by ENSO-related anomalies in radiative forcing by Australian dust over the south-west Pacific Ocean; these anomalies increase (decrease) surface evaporation in La Ni±a (El Ni±o) years. Some of this moisture is advected towards eastern Australia, where increased (decreased) moisture convergence in La Ni±a (El Ni±o) years increases the amplitude of ENSO-related rainfall variability. The modulation of surface evaporation by dust over the south-west Pacific occurs via surface radiative forcing and dust-induced stabilisation of the boundary layer. The results suggest that (1) a realistic treatment of Australian dust may be necessary for accurate simulation of the ENSO-rainfall relationship over Australia, and (2) radiative feedbacks involving dust may be important for understanding natural rainfall variability over Australia. {\textcopyright} 2011 Author(s).},

abstract = {Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are an important freshwater resource for large populations living downstream who rely on runoff for hydropower, irrigation, and municipal use. Projections of glacier mass change and runoff therefore have important socio-economic impacts. In this study, we use a new dataset of geodetic mass balance observations of almost all glaciers in the region to calibrate the Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) using Bayesian inference. The new dataset enables the model to capture spatial variations in mass balance and the Bayesian inference enables the uncertainty associated with the model parameters to be quantified. Validation with historical mass balance observations shows the model performs well and the uncertainty is well captured. Projections of glacier mass change for 22 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) estimate that by the end of the century glaciers in High Mountain Asia will lose between 29 ± 12{\%} (RCP 2.6) and 67 ± 10{\%} (RCP 8.5) of their total mass relative to 2015. Considerable spatial and temporal variability exists between regions due to the climate forcing and glacier characteristics (hypsometry, ice thickness, elevation range). Projections of annual glacier runoff reveal most monsoon-fed river basins (Ganges, Brahmaputra) will hit a maximum (peak water) prior to 2050, while the Indus and other westerlies-fed river basins will likely hit peak water after 2050 due to significant contributions from excess glacier meltwater. Monsoon-fed watersheds are projected to experience large reductions in end-of-summer glacier runoff. Uncertainties in projections at regional scales are dominated by the uncertainty associated with the climate forcing, while at the individual glacier level, uncertainties associated with model parameters can be significant.},

abstract = {The new 3.6 version of the Louvain-la-Neuve sea ice model (LIM) is presented, as integrated in the most recent stable release of Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) (3.6). The release will be used for the next Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6). Developments focussed around three axes: improvements of robustness, versatility and sophistication of the code, which involved numerous changes. Robustness was improved by enforcing exact conservation through the inspection of the different processes driving the air-ice-ocean exchanges of heat, mass and salt. Versatility was enhanced by implementing lateral boundary conditions for sea ice and more flexible ice thickness categories. The latter includes a more practical computation of category boundaries, parameterizations to use LIM3.6 with a single ice category and a flux redistributor for coupling with atmospheric models that cannot handle multiple sub-grid fluxes. Sophistication was upgraded by including the effect of ice and snow weight on the sea surface. We illustrate some of the new capabilities of the code in two standard simulations. One is an ORCA2-LIM3 global simulation at a nominal 2° resolution, forced by reference atmospheric climatologies. The other one is a regional simulation at 2 km resolution around the Svalbard Archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, with open boundaries and tides. We show that the LIM3.6 forms a solid and flexible base for future scientific studies and model developments.},

abstract = {Projections of the contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to future sea-level rise include uncertainties primarily due to the imposed climate forcing and the initial state of the ice sheet model. Several state-of-the-art ice flow models are currently being employed on various grid resolutions to estimate future mass changes in the framework of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). Here we investigate the sensitivity to grid resolution of centennial sea-level contributions from the Greenland ice sheet and study the mechanism at play.We employ the finiteelement higher-order Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) and conduct experiments with four different horizontal resolutions, namely 4, 2, 1 and 0.75 km. We run the simulation based on the ISMIP6 core climate forcing from the MIROC5 global circulation model (GCM) under the highemission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and consider both atmospheric and oceanic forcing in full and separate scenarios. Under the full scenarios, finer simulations unveil up to approximately 5{\%} more sea-level rise compared to the coarser resolution. The sensitivity depends on the magnitude of outlet glacier retreat, which is implemented as a series of retreat masks following the ISMIP6 protocol. Without imposed retreat under atmosphereonly forcing, the resolution dependency exhibits an opposite behaviour with approximately 5{\%} more sea-level contribution in the coarser resolution. The sea-level contribution indicates a converging behaviour below a 1 km horizontal resolution. A driving mechanism for differences is the ability to resolve the bedrock topography, which highly controls ice discharge to the ocean. Additionally, thinning and acceleration emerge to propagate further inland in high resolution for many glaciers. A major response mechanism is sliding, with an enhanced feedback on the effective normal pressure at higher resolution leading to a larger increase in sliding speeds under scenarios with outlet glacier retreat.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change "hotspots" of the twenty-first century, and the physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore, complex interactions and feedbacks involving ocean-atmosphere-land-biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust climate change information for use in vulnerability-impact-adaptation assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models. The coordination activities and the scientific outcomes of Med-CORDEX can produce an important framework to foster the development of regional Earth system models in several key regions worldwide.},

abstract = {The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in the latest version of CNRM climate model, CNRM-CM6-1, and in its high-resolution counterpart, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, is significantly larger than in the previous version (CNRM-CM5.1). The traceability of this climate sensitivity change is investigated using coupled ocean-atmosphere model climate change simulations. These simulations show that the increase in ECS is the result of changes in the atmospheric component. A particular attention is paid to the method used to decompose the equilibrium temperature response difference, by using a linearized decomposition of the individual radiative agents diagnosed by a radiative kernel technique. The climate sensitivity increase is primarily due to the cloud radiative responses, with a predominant contribution of the tropical longwave response (including both feedback and forcing adjustment) and a significant contribution of the extratropical and tropical shortwave feedback changes. A series of stand-alone atmosphere experiments is carried out to quantify the contributions of each atmospheric development to this difference between CNRM-CM5.1 and CNRM-CM6-1. The change of the convection scheme appears to play an important role in driving the cloud changes, with a large effect on the tropical longwave cloud feedback change.},

abstract = {The present paper revisits the future surfaceclimate experiments on the Greenland ice sheet proposed by the Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE; Bindschadler et al., 2013) study. The projections of the different SeaRISE participants show dispersion, which has not been examined in detail to date. A series of sensitivity experiments are conducted and analyzed using the ice-sheet model for integrated Earth-system studies (IcIES) by replacing one or more formulations of the model parameters with those adopted in other model(s). The results show that large potential sources of the dispersion among the projections of the different SeaRISE participants are differences in the initialization methods and in the surface mass balance methods, and both aspects have almost equal impact on the results. The treatment of ice-sheet margins in the simulation has a secondary impact on the dispersion. We conclude that spinning up the model using fixed topography through the spin-up period while the temperature is allowed to evolve according to the surface temperature history is the preferred representation, at least for the experiment configuration examined in the present paper. A benchmark model experimental setup that most of the numerical models can perform is proposed for future intercomparison projects, in order to evaluate the uncertainties relating to pure ice-sheet model flow characteristics.},

Two possible explanations have been proposed for this difference in glacier behaviour: spatial heterogeneity in climate change (climatic forcing) or differing glacier responses to climate change (glacier response). However, neither explanation has strong supporting evidence. Here, we examine the glacial response by calculating the mass-balance sensitivity to temperature change in high-mountain Asia. In support of the glacier-response explanation, we find a strong correlation between observed glacier surface-elevation changes and mass-balance sensitivity of glaciers. The high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.61) suggests that spatially heterogeneous mass-balance sensitivity has more explanatory power than regionally different climate change for the recent contrasting glacier fluctuations in the high mountain Asia.},

abstract = {This study assessed the regional climate models (RCMs) employed in the Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) South Asia framework to investigate the qualitative aspects of future change in seasonal mean near surface air temperature and precipitation over the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. These RCMs downscaled a subset of atmosphere ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) to higher 50 km spatial resolution over a large domain covering South Asia for two representation concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) future scenarios. The analysis specifically examined and evaluated multi-model and multi-scenario climate change projections over the hilly sub-regions within HKH for the near-future (2036–2065) and far-future (2066–2095) periods. The downscaled multi-RCMs provide relatively better confidence than their driving AOGCMs in projecting the magnitude of seasonal warming for the hilly sub-region within the Karakoram and northwestern Himalaya, with higher projected change of 5.4 °C during winter than of 4.9 °C during summer monsoon season by the end of 21st century under the high-end emissions (RCP8.5) scenario. There is less agreement among these RCMs on the magnitude of the projected warming over the other sub-regions within HKH for both seasons, particularly associated with higher RCM uncertainty for the hilly sub-region within the central Himalaya. The downscaled multi-RCMs show good consensus and low RCM uncertainty in projecting that the summer monsoon precipitation will intensify by about 22{\%} in the hilly sub-region within the southeastern Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau for the far-future period under the RCP8.5 scenario. There is low confidence in the projected changes in the summer monsoon and winter season precipitation over the central Himalaya and in the Karakoram and northwestern Himalaya due to poor consensus and moderate to high RCM uncertainty among the downscaled multi-RCMs. Finally, the RCM related uncertainty is found to be large for the projected changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation over the hilly sub-regions within HKH by the end of this century, suggesting that improving the regional processes and feedbacks in RCMs are essential for narrowing the uncertainty, and for providing more reliable regional climate change projections suitable for impact assessments in HKH region.},

Within this grid a frac(1, 24) ° resolution model of the Strait of Gibraltar is embedded. The two grids belong to different models that are coupled through an external parallel driver. The robustness of the adopted grid refinement procedure is tested on a multi-decadal integration simulating the present climate. The good agreement found between the model circulation and most of the available observations confirms both the robustness and effectiveness of the two-way grid refinement technique. The effects produced on the Mediterranean circulation by the grid refinement are investigated through the comparison of two simulations differing only in the presence of the grid refinement. Even though the main characteristics of the thermohaline circulation appear similar in the two simulations, some quantitative and qualitative differences are observed: the main differences found in the Strait of Gibraltar propagate into the whole basin, have an impact on the water column stratification, and consequently on the convection events. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Soil moisture modifies the state of the atmosphere and thus plays a major role in the climate system. Its spatial distribution is strongly modulated by the underlying orography. Yet the vertical transport of soil water and especially the generation of groundwater runoff at the bottom of the soil column are currently treated in a crude way in most atmospheric and climate models. This potentially leads to large biases in near-surface temperatures during midlatitude summertime conditions, when the soils may dry out. Here we present a new formulation for groundwater and runoff formation. It is based on Richards equation, allows for saturated aquifers, includes a slope-dependent groundwater discharge, and enables a subgrid-scale treatment of the underlying orography. The proposed numerical implementation ensures a physically consistent treatment of the water fluxes in the soil column, using ideas from flux-corrected transport methodologies. An implementation of this formulation into TERRA{\_}ML, the land surface model of the regional climate model of the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdeling (COSMO) in CLimate Mode (CCLM), is validated both in idealized and real-case simulations. Idealized simulations demonstrate the important role of the lower boundary condition at the bottom of the soil column and display a physically meaningful recharge and discharge of the saturated zone. Validation against measurements at selected stations shows an improved seasonal evolution of soil water content. Finally, decade-long climate simulations over Europe exhibit a realistic representation of the groundwater distribution across continental scales and mountainous areas, an improved annual cycle of surface latent heat fluxes, and as a consequence reductions of long-standing biases in near-surface temperatures in semiarid regions.},

abstract = {Idealised and hindcast simulations performed with the stand-alone ocean carbon-cycle configuration of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-OC) are described and evaluated. We present simulation results of three different model configurations (two different model versions at different grid resolutions) using two different atmospheric forcing data sets. Model version NorESM-OC1 corresponds to the version that is included in the NorESM-ME1 fully coupled model, which participated in CMIP5. The main update between NorESM-OC1 and NorESM-OC1.2 is the addition of two new options for the treatment of sinking particles. We find that using a constant sinking speed, which has been the standard in NorESM's ocean carbon cycle module HAMOCC (HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model), does not transport enough particulate organic carbon (POC) into the deep ocean below approximately 2000m depth. The two newly implemented parameterisations, a particle aggregation scheme with prognostic sinking speed, and a simpler scheme that uses a linear increase in the sinking speed with depth, provide better agreement with observed POC fluxes. Additionally, reduced deep ocean biases of oxygen and remineralised phosphate indicate a better performance of the new parameterisations. For model version 1.2, a re-tuning of the ecosystem parameterisation has been performed, which (i) reduces previously too high primary production at high latitudes, (ii) consequently improves model results for surface nutrients, and (iii) reduces alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon biases at low latitudes. We use hindcast simulations with prescribed observed and constant (pre-industrial) atmospheric CO2 concentrations to derive the past and contemporary ocean carbon sink. For the period 1990-1999 we find an average ocean carbon uptake ranging from 2.01 to 2.58PgCyr-1 depending on model version, grid resolution, and atmospheric forcing data set.},

abstract = {A new approach of coordinated global and regional climate modeling is presented. It is applied to the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) and its parent global climate model CanESM2. CanRCM4 was developed specifically to downscale climate predictions and climate projections made by its parent global model. The close association of a regional climate model (RCM) with a parent global climate model (GCM) offers novel avenues of model development and application that are not typically available to independent regional climate modeling centers. For example, when CanRCM4 is driven by its parent model, driving information for all of its prognostic variables is available (including aerosols and chemical species), significantly improving the quality of their simulation. Additionally, CanRCM4 can be driven by its parent model for all downscaling applications by employing a spectral nudging procedure in CanESM2 designed to constrain its evolution to follow any large-scale driving data. Coordination offers benefit to the development of physical parameterizations and provides an objective means to evaluate the scalability of such parameterizations across a range of spatial resolutions. Finally, coordinating regional and global modeling efforts helps to highlight the importance of assessing RCMs' value added relative to their driving global models. As a first step in this direction, a framework for identifying appreciable differences in RCM versus GCM climate change results is proposed and applied to CanRCM4 and CanESM2.},

abstract = {This study introduces CNRM-ESM2-1, the Earth system (ES) model of second generation developed by CNRM-CERFACS for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). CNRM-ESM2-1 offers a higher model complexity than the Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model CNRM-CM6-1 by adding interactive ES components such as carbon cycle, aerosols, and atmospheric chemistry. As both models share the same code, physical parameterizations, and grid resolution, they offer a fully traceable framework to investigate how far the represented ES processes impact the model performance over present-day, response to external forcing and future climate projections. Using a large variety of CMIP6 experiments, we show that represented ES processes impact more prominently the model response to external forcing than the model performance over present-day. Both models display comparable performance at replicating modern observations although the mean climate of CNRM-ESM2-1 is slightly warmer than that of CNRM-CM6-1. This difference arises from land cover-aerosol interactions where the use of different soil vegetation distributions between both models impacts the rate of dust emissions. This interaction results in a smaller aerosol burden in CNRM-ESM2-1 than in CNRM-CM6-1, leading to a different surface radiative budget and climate. Greater differences are found when comparing the model response to external forcing and future climate projections. Represented ES processes damp future warming by up to 10{\%} in CNRM-ESM2-1 with respect to CNRM-CM6-1. The representation of land vegetation and the CO2-water-stomatal feedback between both models explain about 60{\%} of this difference. The remainder is driven by other ES feedbacks such as the natural aerosol feedback.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: The changes or updates in ocean biogeochemistry component have been mapped between CMIP5 and CMIP6 model versions, and an assessment made of how far these have led to improvements in the simulated mean state of marine biogeochemical models within the current generation of Earth system models (ESMs). Recent Findings: The representation of marine biogeochemistry has progressed within the current generation of Earth system models. However, it remains difficult to identify which model updates are responsible for a given improvement. In addition, the full potential of marine biogeochemistry in terms of Earth system interactions and climate feedback remains poorly examined in the current generation of Earth system models. Summary: Increasing availability of ocean biogeochemical data, as well as an improved understanding of the underlying processes, allows advances in the marine biogeochemical components of the current generation of ESMs. The present study scrutinizes the extent to which marine biogeochemistry components of ESMs have progressed between the 5th and the 6th phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).},

abstract = {The general circulation models used to simulate global climate typically feature resolution too coarse to reproduce many smaller-scale processes, which are crucial to determining the regional responses to climate change. A novel approach to downscale climate change scenarios is presented which includes the interactions between the North Atlantic Ocean and the European shelves as well as their impact on the North Atlantic and European climate. The goal of this paper is to introduce the global ocean-regional atmosphere coupling concept and to show the potential benefits of this model system to simulate present-day climate. A global ocean-sea ice-marine biogeochemistry model (MPIOM/HAMOCC) with regionally high horizontal resolution is coupled to an atmospheric regional model (REMO) and global terrestrial hydrology model (HD) via the OASIS coupler. Moreover, results obtained with ROM using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and ECHAM5/MPIOM CMIP3 historical simulations as boundary conditions are presented and discussed for the North Atlantic and North European region. The validation of all the model components, i.e., ocean, atmosphere, terrestrial hydrology, and ocean biogeochemistry is performed and discussed. The careful and detailed validation of ROM provides evidence that the proposed model system improves the simulation of many aspects of the regional climate, remarkably the ocean, even though some biases persist in other model components, thus leaving potential for future improvement. We conclude that ROM is a powerful tool to estimate possible impacts of climate change on the regional scale.},

abstract = {We discuss the performance of the Finite Element Ocean Model (FESOM) on locally eddy-resolving global unstructured meshes. In particular, the utility of the mesh design approach whereby mesh horizontal resolution is varied as half the Rossby radius in most of the model domain is explored. Model simulations on such a mesh (FESOM-XR) are compared with FESOM simulations on a smaller-size mesh, where refinement depends only on the pattern of observed variability (FESOM-HR). We also compare FESOM results to a simulation of the ocean model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPIOM) on a tripolar regular grid with refinement toward the poles, which uses a number of degrees of freedom similar to FESOM-XR. The mesh design strategy, which relies on the Rossby radius and/or the observed variability pattern, tends to coarsen the resolution in tropical and partly subtropical latitudes compared to the regular MPIOM grid. Excessive variations of mesh resolution are found to affect the performance in other nearby areas, presumably through dissipation that increases if resolution is coarsened. The largest improvement shown by FESOM-XR is a reduction of the surface temperature bias in the so-called North-West corner of the North Atlantic Ocean where horizontal resolution was increased dramatically. However, other biases in FESOM-XR remain largely unchanged compared to FESOM-HR. We conclude that resolving the Rossby radius alone (with two points per Rossby radius) is insufficient, and that careful use of a priori information on eddy dynamics is required to exploit the full potential of ocean models on unstructured meshes.},

abstract = {It is often unclear how to optimally choose horizontal resolution for the oceanic and atmospheric components of coupled climate models, which has implications for their ability to make best use of available computational resources. Here we investigate the effect of using different combinations of horizontal resolutions in atmosphere and ocean on the simulated climate in a global coupled climate model (Alfred Wegener Institute Climate Model [AWI-CM]). Particular attention is given to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Four experiments with different combinations of relatively high and low resolutions in the ocean and atmosphere are conducted. We show that increases in atmospheric and oceanic resolution have clear impacts on the simulated AMOC, which are largely independent. Increased atmospheric resolution leads to a weaker AMOC. It also improves the simulated Gulf Stream separation; however, this is only the case if the ocean is locally eddy resolving and reacts to the improved atmosphere. We argue that our results can be explained by reduced mean winds caused by higher cyclone activity. Increased resolution of the ocean affects the AMOC in several ways, thereby locally increasing or reducing the AMOC. The finer topography (and reduced dissipation) in the vicinity of the Caribbean basin tends to locally increase the AMOC. However, there is a reduction in the AMOC around 45°N, which relates to the reduced mixed layer depth in the Labrador Sea in simulations with refined ocean and changes in the North Atlantic current pathway. Furthermore, the eddy-induced changes in the Southern Ocean increase the strength of the deep cell.},

The atmosphere component of NorESM2 (CAM-Nor) includes a different module for aerosol physics and chemistry, including interactions with cloud and radiation; additionally, CAMNor includes improvements in the formulation of local dry and moist energy conservation, in local and global angular momentum conservation, and in the computations for deep convection and air-sea fluxes. The surface components of NorESM2 have minor changes in the albedo calculations and to land and sea-ice models. We present results from simulations with NorESM2 that were carried out for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Two versions of the model are used: one with lower (∼2°) atmosphere-land resolution and one with medium (∼1°) atmosphere-land resolution. The stability of the pre-industrial climate and the sensitivity of the model to abrupt and gradual quadrupling of CO2 are assessed, along with the ability of the model to simulate the historical climate under the CMIP6 forcings. Compared to observations and reanalyses, NorESM2 represents an improvement over previous versions of NorESM in most aspects. NorESM2 appears less sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing than its predecessors, with an estimated equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.5K in both resolutions on a 150-year time frame; however, this estimate increases with the time window and the climate sensitivity at equilibration is much higher. We also consider the model response to future scenarios as defined by selected Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project defined under CMIP6. Under the four scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5), the warming in the period 2090-2099 compared to 1850-1879 reaches 1.3, 2.2, 3.0, and 3.9K in NorESM2-LM, and 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.9K in NorESM-MM, robustly similar in both resolutions. NorESM2-LM shows a rather satisfactory evolution of recent sea-ice area. In NorESM2-LM, an ice-free Arctic Ocean is only avoided in the SSP1-2.6 scenario.},

abstract = {We document the development of the first version of the U.K. Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1.},

FESOM is coupled to the Max Planck Institute atmospheric model ECHAM 6.3 at a horizontal resolution of about 100 km. Using objective performance indices, it is shown that AWI-CM performs better than the average of CMIP5 models. AWI-CM shows an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.2°C, which is similar to the CMIP5 average, and a transient climate response of 2.1°C which is slightly higher than the CMIP5 average. The negative trend of Arctic sea-ice extent in September over the past 30 years is 20–30{\%} weaker in our simulations compared to observations. With the strongest emission scenario, the AMOC decreases by 25{\%} until the end of the century which is less than the CMIP5 average of 40{\%}. Patterns and even magnitude of simulated temperature and precipitation changes at the end of this century compared to present-day climate under the strong emission scenario SSP585 are similar to the multi-model CMIP5 mean. The simulations show a 11°C warming north of the Barents Sea and around 2°C to 3°C over most parts of the ocean as well as a wetting of the Arctic, subpolar, tropical, and Southern Ocean. Furthermore, in the northern middle latitudes in boreal summer and autumn as well as in the southern middle latitudes, a more zonal atmospheric flow is projected throughout the year.},

abstract = {The fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) was used to dynamically downscale two Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) simulations of the transient climate change for the period 1950-2100, over North America, following the CORDEX protocol. The CRCM5 was driven by data from the CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-LR CGCM simulations, based on the historical (1850-2005) and future (2006-2100) RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario. The results show that the CRCM5 simulations reproduce relatively well the current-climate North American regional climatic features, such as the temperature and precipitation multiannual means, annual cycles and temporal variability at daily scale. A cold bias was noted during the winter season over western and southern portions of the continent. CRCM5-simulated precipitation accumulations at daily temporal scale are much more realistic when compared with its driving CGCM simulations, especially in summer when small-scale driven convective precipitation has a large contribution over land. The CRCM5 climate projections imply a general warming over the continent in the 21st century, especially over the northern regions in winter. The winter warming is mostly contributed by the lower percentiles of daily temperatures, implying a reduction in the frequency and intensity of cold waves. A precipitation decrease is projected over Central America and an increase over the rest of the continent. For the average precipitation change in summer however there is little consensus between the simulations. Some of these differences can be attributed to the uncertainties in CGCM-projected changes in the position and strength of the Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Observations show that the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at an increasing rate over the past few decades, which makes it a major contributor to sea-level rise. Here we use a threedimensional higher-order ice-flow model, adaptive mesh refinement and inverse methods to accurately reproduce the present-day ice flow of the Greenland ice sheet. We investigate the effect of the ice thermal regime on (1) basal sliding inversion and (2) projections over the next 100 years. We show that steady-state temperatures based on present-day conditions allow a reasonable representation of the thermal regime and that both basal conditions and century-scale projections are weakly sensitive to small changes in the initial temperature field, compared with changes in atmospheric conditions or basal sliding. We conclude that although more englacial temperature measurements should be acquired to validate the models, and a better estimation of geothermal heat flux is needed, it is reasonable to use steady-state temperature profiles for short-term projections, as external forcings remain the main drivers of the changes occurring in Greenland. {\textcopyright} 2014 Publishing Technology.},

abstract = {Ice sheet numerical modeling is an important tool to estimate the dynamic contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to sea level rise over the coming centuries. The influence of initial conditions on ice sheet model simulations, however, is still unclear. To better understand this influence, an initial state intercomparison exercise (initMIP) has been developed to compare, evaluate, and improve initialization procedures and estimate their impact on century-scale simulations. initMIP is the first set of experiments of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6), which is the primary Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) activity focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Following initMIP-Greenland, initMIP-Antarctica has been designed to explore uncertainties associated with model initialization and spin-up and to evaluate the impact of changes in external forcings. Starting from the state of the Antarctic ice sheet at the end of the initialization procedure, three forward experiments are each run for 100 years: a control run, a run with a surface mass balance anomaly, and a run with a basal melting anomaly beneath floating ice. This study presents the results of initMIP-Antarctica from 25 simulations performed by 16 international modeling groups. The submitted results use different initial conditions and initialization methods, as well as ice flow model parameters and reference external forcings. We find a good agreement among model responses to the surface mass balance anomaly but large variations in responses to the basal melting anomaly. These variations can be attributed to differences in the extent of ice shelves and their upstream tributaries, the numerical treatment of grounding line, and the initial ocean conditions applied, suggesting that ongoing efforts to better represent ice shelves in continental-scale models should continue.},

abstract = {Ice flow models of the Antarctic ice sheet are commonly used to simulate its future evolution in response to different climate scenarios and assess the mass loss that would contribute to future sea level rise. However, there is currently no consensus on estimates of the future mass balance of the ice sheet, primarily because of differences in the representation of physical processes, forcings employed and initial states of ice sheet models. This study presents results from ice flow model simulations from 13 international groups focusing on the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the period 2015-2100 as part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). They are forced with outputs from a subset of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), representative of the spread in climate model results. Simulations of the Antarctic ice sheet contribution to sea level rise in response to increased warming during this period varies between 7:8 and 30.0 cm of sea level equivalent (SLE) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario forcing. These numbers are relative to a control experiment with constant climate conditions and should therefore be added to the mass loss contribution under climate conditions similar to presentday conditions over the same period. The simulated evolution of the West Antarctic ice sheet varies widely among models, with an overall mass loss, up to 18.0 cm SLE, in response to changes in oceanic conditions. East Antarctica mass change varies between 6:1 and 8.3 cm SLE in the simulations, with a significant increase in surface mass balance outweighing the increased ice discharge under most RCP 8.5 scenario forcings. The inclusion of ice shelf collapse, here assumed to be caused by large amounts of liquid water ponding at the surface of ice shelves, yields an additional simulated mass loss of 28mm compared to simulations without ice shelf collapse. The largest sources of uncertainty come from the climate forcing, the ocean-induced melt rates, the calibration of these melt rates based on oceanic conditions taken outside of ice shelf cavities and the ice sheet dynamic response to these oceanic changes. Results under RCP 2.6 scenario based on two CMIP5 climate models show an additional mass loss of 0 and 3 cm of SLE on average compared to simulations done under present-day conditions for the two CMIP5 forcings used and display limited mass gain in East Antarctica.},

abstract = {The Paris agreement aims to hold global warming to well below 2 °C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C relative to the pre-industrial period. Recent estimates based on population growth and intended carbon emissions from participant countries suggest global warming may exceed this ambitious target. Here we present glacier volume projections for the end of this century, under a range of high-end climate change scenarios, defined as exceeding +2° C global average warming relative to the pre-industrial period. Glacier volume is modelled by developing an elevation-dependent mass balance model for the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES). To do this, we modify JULES to include glaciated and unglaciated surfaces that can exist at multiple heights within a single grid box. Present-day mass balance is calibrated by tuning albedo, wind speed, precipitation, and temperature lapse rates to obtain the best agreement with observed mass balance profiles. JULES is forced with an ensemble of six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, which were downscaled using the high-resolution HadGEM3-A atmosphere-only global climate model. The CMIP5 models use the RCP8.5 climate change scenario and were selected on the criteria of passing 2 °C global average warming during this century. The ensemble mean volume loss at the end of the century plus or minus 1 standard deviation is-64±5{\%} for all glaciers excluding those on the peripheral of the Antarctic ice sheet. The uncertainty in the multi-model mean is rather small and caused by the sensitivity of HadGEM3-A to the boundary conditions supplied by the CMIP5 models. The regions which lose more than 75{\%} of their initial volume by the end of the century are Alaska, western Canada and the US, Iceland, Scandinavia, the Russian Arctic, central Europe, Caucasus, high-mountain Asia, low latitudes, southern Andes, and New Zealand. The ensemble mean ice loss expressed in sea level equivalent contribution is 215.2±21.3 mm. The largest contributors to sea level rise are Alaska (44.6±1.1 mm), Arctic Canada north and south (34.9±3.0 mm), the Russian Arctic (33.3±4.8 mm), Greenland (20.1±4.4), high-mountain Asia (combined central Asia, South Asia east and west), (18.0±0.8 mm), southern Andes (14.4±0.1 mm), and Svalbard (17.0±4.6 mm). Including parametric uncertainty in the calibrated mass balance parameters gives an upper bound global volume loss of 281.1mm of sea level equivalent by the end of the century. Such large ice losses will have inevitable consequences for sea level rise and for water supply in glacier-fed river systems.},

abstract = {A model of atmospheric composition and climate has been developed at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) that includes composition seamlessly from the surface to the lower mesosphere. The model is able to capture many features of the observed magnitude, distribution, and seasonal cycle of trace species. The simulation is especially realistic in the troposphere. In the stratosphere, high latitude regions show substantial biases during period when transport governs the distribution as meridional mixing is too rapid in this model version. In other regions, including the extrapolar tropopause region that dominates radiative forcing (RF) by ozone, stratospheric gases are generally well-simulated. The model's stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) agrees well with values inferred from observations for both the global mean flux and the ratio of Northern (NH) to Southern Hemisphere (SH) downward fluxes. Simulations of preindustrial (PI) to present-day (PD) changes show tropospheric ozone burden increases of 11{\%} while the stratospheric burden decreases by 18{\%}. The resulting tropopause RF values are -0.06 W/m2 from stratospheric ozone and 0.40 W/m2 from tropospheric ozone. Global mean mass-weighted OH decreases by 16{\%} from the PI to the PD. STE of ozone also decreased substantially during this time, by 14{\%}. Comparison of the PD with a simulation using 1979 pre-ozone hole conditions for the stratosphere shows a much larger downward flux of ozone into the troposphere in 1979, resulting in a substantially greater tropospheric ozone burden than that seen in the PD run. This implies that reduced STE due to stratospheric ozone depletion may have offset as much as 2/3 of the tropospheric ozone burden increase from PI to PD. However, the model overestimates the downward flux of ozone at high Southern latitudes, so this estimate is likely an upper limit. In the future, the tropospheric ozone burden increases by 101{\%} in 2100 for the A2 scenario including both emissions and climate changes. The primary reason is enhanced STE, which increases by 124{\%} (168{\%} in the SH extratropics, and 114{\%} in the NH extratropics). Climate plays a minimal role in the SH increases, but contributes 38{\%} in the NH. Chemistry and dry deposition both change so as to reduce tropospheric ozone, partially in compensation for the enhanced STE, but the increased ozone influx dominates the burden changes. The net RF due to projected ozone changes is 0.8 W/m2for A2. The influence of climate change alone is -0.2 W/m2, making it a substantial contributor to the net RF. The tropospheric oxidation capacity increases seven percent in the full A2 simulation, and 36{\%} due to A2 climate change alone.},

abstract = {Decadal long simulations of atmospheric circulation in the high latitudes have been carried out using a multiscale atmospheric modeling system that consists of MGO global and regional atmospheric models with respective resolutions of 200, 50 and 25 km in the horizontal. The detailed analysis of extratropical cyclone activity including activity of polar mesocyclones has been conducted for the winter season using an advanced cyclone identification and tracking scheme. To enhance the applicability of high-resolution regional atmospheric modeling in the context of detailed general atmospheric circulation analysis, an end-to-end approach for cyclone trajectory calculation on a unified global and regional grid has been proposed. It has been shown that increasing modeling resolution in the high latitudes allows one to more realistically simulate the activity of baroclinic waves and the thermal regime of the Arctic troposphere. The statistical structure of cyclonic activity has been investigated depending on the spatial resolution of the modeling system and compared with that in the reanalyses and satellite-derived analyses. The performance of the atmospheric models in the simulation of extreme cyclones is evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A new climate model has been developed that employs a multi-resolution dynamical core for the sea ice-ocean component. In principle, the multi-resolution approach allows one to use enhanced horizontal resolution in dynamically active regions while keeping a coarse-resolution setup otherwise. The coupled model consists of the atmospheric model ECHAM6 and the finite element sea ice-ocean model (FESOM). In this study only moderate refinement of the unstructured ocean grid is applied and the resolution varies from about 25 km in the northern North Atlantic and in the tropics to about 150 km in parts of the open ocean; the results serve as a benchmark upon which future versions that exploit the potential of variable resolution can be built. Details of the formulation of the model are given and its performance in simulating observed aspects of the mean climate is described. Overall, it is found that ECHAM6–FESOM realistically simulates many aspects of the observed climate. More specifically it is found that ECHAM6–FESOM performs at least as well as some of the most sophisticated climate models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. ECHAM6–FESOM shares substantial shortcomings with other climate models when it comes to simulating the North Atlantic circulation.},

abstract = {High-resolution global climate modeling holds the promise of capturing planetary-scale climate modes and small-scale (regional and sometimes extreme) features simultaneously, including their mutual interaction. This paper discusses a new state-of-the-art high-resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulation that was performed with these goals in mind. The atmospheric component was at 0.25° grid spacing, and ocean component at 0.1°. One hundred years of "present-day" simulation were completed. Major results were that annual mean sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific and El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation variability were well simulated compared to standard resolution models. Tropical and southern Atlantic SST also had much reduced bias compared to previous versions of the model. In addition, the high resolution of the model enabled small-scale features of the climate system to be represented, such as air-sea interaction over ocean frontal zones, mesoscale systems generated by the Rockies, and Tropical Cyclones. Associated single component runs and standard resolution coupled runs are used to help attribute the strengths and weaknesses of the fully coupled run. The high-resolution run employed 23,404 cores, costing 250 thousand processor-hours per simulated year and made about two simulated years per day on the NCAR-Wyoming supercomputer "Yellowstone." Key Points: A new synoptic-resolving CESM simulation has been performed for 100 years Good representation of Tropical sea surface temperature Realistic levels of El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation variability},

abstract = {The LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model uniquely combines an individual- and patch-based representation of vegetation dynamics with ecosystem biogeochemical cycling from regional to global scales. We present an updated version that includes plant and soil N dynamics, analysing the implications of accounting for C-N interactions on predictions and performance of the model. Stand structural dynamics and allometric scaling of tree growth suggested by global databases of forest stand structure and development were well reproduced by the model in comparison to an earlier multi-model study. Accounting for N cycle dynamics improved the goodness of fit for broadleaved forests. N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates reduces productivity of cold-climate and dry-climate ecosystems relative to mesic temperate and tropical ecosystems. In a model experiment emulating free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) treatment for forests globally, N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates of colder soils reduces CO2 enhancement of net primary production (NPP) for boreal forests, while some temperate and tropical forests exhibit increased NPP enhancement. Under a business-as-usual future climate and emissions scenario, ecosystem C storage globally was projected to increase by ca. 10{\%}; additional N requirements to match this increasing ecosystem C were within the high N supply limit estimated on stoichiometric grounds in an earlier study. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for C-N interactions in studies of global terrestrial N cycling, and as a basis for understanding mechanisms on local scales and in different regional contexts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {Twenty-first century projections for the Mediterranean water properties have been analyzed using the largest ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) available up to now, the Med-CORDEX ensemble. It is comprised by 25 simulations, 10 historical and 15 scenario projections, from which 11 are ocean–atmosphere coupled runs and 4 are ocean forced simulations. Three different emissions scenarios are considered: RCP8.5, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6. All the simulations agree in projecting a warming across the entire Mediterranean basin by the end of the century as a result of the decrease of heat losses to the atmosphere through the sea surface and an increase in the net heat input through the Strait of Gibraltar. The warming will affect the whole water column with higher anomalies in the upper layer. The temperature change projected by the end of the century ranges between 0.81 and 3.71 °C in the upper layer (0–150 m), between 0.82 and 2.97 °C in the intermediate layer (150–600 m) and between 0.15 and 0.18 °C in the deep layer (600 m—bottom). The intensity of the warming is strongly dependent on the choice of emission scenario and, in second order, on the choice of Global Circulation Model (GCM) used to force the RCM. On the other hand, the local structures reproduced by each simulation are mainly determined by the regional model and not by the scenario or the global model. The salinity also increases in all the simulation due to the increase of the freshwater deficit (i.e. the excess of evaporation over precipitation and river runoff) and the related increase in the net salt transport at the Gibraltar Strait. However, in the upper layer this process can be damped or enhanced depending upon the characteristics of the inflowing waters from the Atlantic. This, in turn, depends on the evolution of salinity in the Northeast Atlantic projected by the GCM. Thus a clear zonal gradient is found in most simulations with large positive salinity anomalies in the eastern basin and a freshening of the upper layer of the western basin in most simulations. The salinity changes projected for the whole basin range between 0 and 0.34 psu in the upper layer, between 0.08 and 0.37 psu in the intermediate layer and between − 0.05 and 0.33 in the deep layer. These changes in the temperature and salinity modify in turn the characteristics of the main water masses as the new waters become saltier, warmer and less dense along the twenty-first century. There is a model consensus that the intensity of the deep water formation in the Gulf of Lions is expected to decrease in the future. The rate of decrease remains however very uncertain depending on the scenario and model chosen. At the contrary, there is no model consensus concerning the change in the intensity of the deep water formation in the Adriatic Sea and in the Aegean Sea, although most models also point to a reduction.},

abstract = {A simple plume implementation of the second version (v2) of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, MACv2-SP, is described. MACv2-SP provides a prescription of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated Twomey effect. It was created to provide a harmonized description of post-1850 anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing for climate modeling studies. MACv2-SP has been designed to be easy to implement, change and use, and thereby enable studies exploring the climatic effects of different patterns of aerosol radiative forcing, including a Twomey effect. MACv2-SP is formulated in terms of nine spatial plumes associated with different major anthropogenic source regions. The shape of the plumes is fit to the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, version 2, whose present-day (2005) distribution is anchored by surface-based observations. Two types of plumes are considered: one predominantly associated with biomass burning, the other with industrial emissions. These differ in the prescription of their annual cycle and in their optical properties, thereby implicitly accounting for different contributions of absorbing aerosol to the different plumes. A Twomey effect for each plume is prescribed as a change in the host model's background cloud-droplet population density using relationships derived from satellite data. Year-to-year variations in the amplitude of the plumes over the historical period (1850-2016) are derived by scaling the plumes with associated national emission sources of SO2 and NH3. Experiments using MACv2-SP are performed with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. The globally and annually averaged instantaneous and effective aerosol radiative forcings are estimated to be -0.6 and -0.5 W m-2, respectively. Forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (the Twomey effect) offsets the reduction of clear-sky forcing by clouds, so that the net effect of clouds on the aerosol forcing is small; hence, the clear-sky forcing, which is more readily measurable, provides a good estimate of the total aerosol forcing.},

abstract = {This contribution describes the ocean biogeochemical component of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Earth System Model 4.1 (GFDL-ESM4.1), assesses GFDL-ESM4.1's capacity to capture observed ocean biogeochemical patterns, and documents its response to increasing atmospheric CO2. Notable differences relative to the previous generation of GFDL ESM's include enhanced resolution of plankton food web dynamics, refined particle remineralization, and a larger number of exchanges of nutrients across Earth system components. During model spin-up, the carbon drift rapidly fell below the 10 Pg C per century equilibration criterion established by the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP). Simulations robustly captured large-scale observed nutrient distributions, plankton dynamics, and characteristics of the biological pump. The model overexpressed phosphate limitation and open ocean hypoxia in some areas but still yielded realistic surface and deep carbon system properties, including cumulative carbon uptake since preindustrial times and over the last decades that is consistent with observation-based estimates. The model's response to the direct and radiative effects of a 200{\%} atmospheric CO2 increase from preindustrial conditions (i.e., years 101–120 of a 1{\%} CO2 yr−1 simulation) included (a) a weakened, shoaling organic carbon pump leading to a 38{\%} reduction in the sinking flux at 2,000 m; (b) a two-thirds reduction in the calcium carbonate pump that nonetheless generated only weak calcite compensation on century time-scales; and, in contrast to previous GFDL ESMs, (c) a moderate reduction in global net primary production that was amplified at higher trophic levels. We conclude with a discussion of model limitations and priority developments.},

abstract = {We present results from a global three-dimensional chemical model for the troposphere, named Chemical AGCM for Study of Atmospheric Environment and Radiative Forcing (CHASER). This model has been developed to simulate the tropospheric photochemistry involving the O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-HO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-NO {\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-CO photochemical system and oxidation of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), based on an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). In this paper, we present results from a climatological run of the model, and evaluate them with observational data. The simulation was conducted at the model horizontal resolution of T21 (5.6° × 5.6°) with 32 vertical layers from the surface to about 40 km altitude. The model reproduces well the observed vertical profiles of CO and NMHCs as ethane, propane, and acetone in almost all cases. The simulated seasonal cycle of surface CO in the biomass-burning region (South America) shows a good agreement with observation. In the case of nitric oxide (NO), the model generally reproduces the observed vertical profiles well, though it appears to somewhat underestimate NO in the upper troposphere in the low latitudes. Although the model overestimates nitric acid (HNO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) in some cases like other model studies, the calculated HNO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is generally within the range of observations. Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) appears to be generally simulated well, but overestimated by the model in some remote regions. In the simulation of O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, the vertical profiles and seasonal variations observed in polluted and remote sites are well reproduced. The ozone distributions calculated in the biomass-burning-related regions as South America, Africa, and the South Atlantic show good agreements with observations. However, in the midlatitudes, the model tends to overestimate O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in the upper troposphere in winter-springtime, maybe indicating the need of improving the model's horizontal resolution. The model calculates a net chemical ozone production of 397 TgO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/yr in the global troposphere (4895 TgO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/yr production and 4498 TgO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/yr destruction). The estimated net O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} flux from the stratosphere is 593 TgO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/yr, well within the range suggested by recent studies. The calculated global OH concentration leads to a global mean CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} lifetime of 7.9 years in this simulation.

abstract = {We present a new global three-dimensional chemical model for the troposphere, named chemical atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) for study of atmospheric environment and radiative forcing (CHASER). This model, developed in the framework of the Center for Climate System Research/National Institute for Environment Studies (CCSR/NIES) AGCM, is aimed to study tropospheric photochemistry and its influences on climate. The chemical component of the model simulates the O3-HOX.-NOX.-CH4-CO photochemical system and oxidation of nonmethane hydrocarbons through 88 chemical and 25 photolytic reactions with 47 chemical species in its present configuration. The model includes emission sources, dry and wet deposition, as well as chemical transformations. Meteorological processes such as transport due to advection, convection, and other subgrid-scale mixing are simulated "on-line" by the dynamical component of the CCSR/NIES AGCM. A detailed evaluation of the model results is presented in a companion paper [Sudo et al., 2002]. An evaluation of the transport scheme adopted in the model suggests that the model is capable of simulating transport associated with convection and boundary layer mixing as well as large-scale advection. The model capability to simulate dry and wet deposition was also evaluated by conducting a simulation of atmospheric lead. The simulated lead distributions are consistent with those observed at the surface, showing the validity of the deposition parameterization adopted in the model.

abstract = {Long-term climate simulations are performed using the IITM Earth System Model version 2 (IITM-ESMv2), a sequel to the earlier version (IITM-ESMv1), to assess climate variability and change with a special focus on the South Asian monsoon. Substantial improvements are incorporated in IITM-ESMv2 to obtain a radiatively balanced global climate modeling framework. The IITM-ESMv2 includes time-varying aerosol forcing and land-use land-cover changes. Multicentury simulations corresponding to preindustrial and present-day conditions show major improvements in capturing key aspects of time-mean atmosphere and ocean large-scale circulation. Representations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and poleward ocean heat transport, and major global climate drivers are superior to ESMv1. Teleconnections of the South Asian monsoon with climate drivers such as the El-Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are found to be more robust in IITM-ESMv2, thus leading to improved simulation of South Asian monsoon and its variability. The IITM-ESMv2 takes a novel pursuit from India to contribute in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) sixth assessment report (AR6).},

abstract = {The Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) is a global model developed to simulate historical climate change and variability, to make centennial-scale projections of future climate, and to produce initialized seasonal and decadal predictions. This paper describes the model components and their coupling, as well as various aspects of model development, including tuning, optimization, and a reproducibility strategy. We also document the stability of the model using a long control simulation, quantify the model's ability to reproduce large-scale features of the historical climate, and evaluate the response of the model to external forcing. CanESM5 is comprised of three-dimensional atmosphere (T63 spectral resolution equivalent roughly to 2.8°) and ocean (nominally 1°) general circulation models, a sea-ice model, a land surface scheme, and explicit land and ocean carbon cycle models. The model features relatively coarse resolution and high throughput, which facilitates the production of large ensembles. CanESM5 has a notably higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (5.6 K) than its predecessor, CanESM2 (3.7 K), which we briefly discuss, along with simulated changes over the historical period. CanESM5 simulations contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and will be employed for climate science and service applications in Canada.},

abstract = {Global aerosol and ozone distributions and their associated radiative forcings were simulated between 1850 and 2100 following a recent historical emission dataset and under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) for the future. These simulations were used in an Earth System Model to account for the changes in both radiatively and chemically active compounds, when simulating the climate evolution. The past negative stratospheric ozone trends result in a negative climate forcing culminating at -0. 15 W m-2 in the 1990s. In the meantime, the tropospheric ozone burden increase generates a positive climate forcing peaking at 0. 41 W m-2. The future evolution of ozone strongly depends on the RCP scenario considered. In RCP4. 5 and RCP6. 0, the evolution of both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone generate relatively weak radiative forcing changes until 2060-2070 followed by a relative 30 {\%} decrease in radiative forcing by 2100. In contrast, RCP8. 5 and RCP2. 6 model projections exhibit strongly different ozone radiative forcing trajectories. In the RCP2. 6 scenario, both effects (stratospheric ozone, a negative forcing, and tropospheric ozone, a positive forcing) decline towards 1950s values while they both get stronger in the RCP8. 5 scenario. Over the twentieth century, the evolution of the total aerosol burden is characterized by a strong increase after World War II until the middle of the 1980s followed by a stabilization during the last decade due to the strong decrease in sulfates in OECD countries since the 1970s. The cooling effects reach their maximal values in 1980, with -0. 34 and -0. 28 W m-2 respectively for direct and indirect total radiative forcings. According to the RCP scenarios, the aerosol content, after peaking around 2010, is projected to decline strongly and monotonically during the twenty-first century for the RCP8. 5, 4. 5 and 2. 6 scenarios. While for RCP6. 0 the decline occurs later, after peaking around 2050. As a consequence the relative importance of the total cooling effect of aerosols becomes weaker throughout the twenty-first century compared with the positive forcing of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, both surface ozone and aerosol content show very different regional features depending on the future scenario considered. Hence, in 2050, surface ozone changes vary between -12 and +12 ppbv over Asia depending on the RCP projection, whereas the regional direct aerosol radiative forcing can locally exceed -3 W m-2. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {A land surface model (LSM), minimal advanced treatments of surface interaction and runoff (MATSIRO), has been developed for climate studies at the global and regional scales. The canopy has a single layer, whose albedo and bulk coefficients are evaluated on the basis of a multilayer canopy model. The fluxes are calculated from the energy balance at the ground and canopy surfaces in snow-free and snow-covered portions considering the subgrid snow distribution. The interception evaporation from canopy and the transpiration on the basis of photosynthesis are treated. A simplified TOPMODEL is used to calculate runoff. The snow has the variable number of layers from one to three in accordance with snow water equivalent (SWE), and the snow temperature is calculated by a thermal conduction equation. Besides, the snowmelt, the refreeze of snowmelt, and the freeze of rainfall in snow are taken into consideration. It is found in the PILPS 2e experiment that some parameters in the runoff scheme, such as the surface hydraulic conductivity and the river channel fraction, have a considerable impact on the partitioning of the surface runoff and the base flow. The snow albedo is prognosticated from the time passage since last snowfall and the snow temperature. The soil has five layers in this version, and the soil temperature, the soil moisture, and the frozen amount of moisture are calculated. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {With a global aerosol transport-radiation model coupled to a general circulation model, changes in the meteorological parameters of clouds, precipitation, and temperature caused by the direct and indirect effects of aerosols are simulated, and its radiative forcing are calculated. A microphysical parameterization diagnosing the cloud droplet number concentration based on the K{\"{o}}hler theory is introduced into the model, which depends not only on the aerosol particle number concentration but also on the updraft velocity, size distributions, and chemical properties of each aerosol species and saturation condition of the water vapor. The simulated cloud droplet effective radius, cloud radiative forcing, and precipitation rate, which relate to the aerosol indirect effect, are in reasonable agreement with satellite observations. The model results indicate that a decrease in the cloud droplet effective radius by anthropogenic aerosols occurs globally, while changes in the cloud water and precipitation are strongly affected by a variation of the dynamical hydrological cycle with a temperature change by the aerosol direct and first indirect effects rather than the second indirect effect itself. However, the cloud water can increase and the precipitation can simultaneously decrease in regions where a large amount of anthropogenic aerosols and cloud water exist, which is a strong signal of the second indirect effect. The global mean radiative forcings of the direct and indirect effects at the tropopause by anthropogenic aerosols are calculated to be -0.1 and -0.9 W m -2, respectively. It is suggested that aerosol particles approximately reduce 40{\%} of the increase in the surface air temperature by anthropogenic greenhouse gases on the global mean.

abstract = {A global three-dimensional model that can treat transportation of various species of aerosols in the atmosphere is developed using a framework of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). Main aerosols in the troposphere, i.e., soil dust, carbonaceous (organic and black carbon), sulfate, and sea-salt aerosols, are introduced into this model. Prior to the model calculations the meteorological parameters are calculated by the AGCM with the nudging technique using reanalysis data. To evaluate aerosol effects on the climate system and to compare simulated results with observations, the optical thickness and Angstrom exponent are also calculated taking into account the size distribution and composition. The model results are validated by both measured surface aerosol concentrations and retrieved aerosol optical parameters from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. A general agreement is found between the simulated result and the observation globally and seasonally. One of the significant results is that the simulated relative contribution of anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosols to the total optical thickness is comparable to that of sulfate aerosols at midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which agrees with recent observations. This result leads to a conclusion that the radiative effect evaluation of aerosols on the climate system is necessary to be modified because optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols are different from those of sulfate aerosols. The other finding is that the seasonal shift off the west coast of North Africa observed by satellites, i.e., the latitude of the maximum optical thickness moves seasonally, is also reproduced in consideration of a mixed state of soil dust and carbonaceous aerosols.

abstract = {In this study an integrated simulation of the global distribution and the radiative forcing of soil dust aerosols at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is performed with an aerosol climate model, SPRINTARS. It is compared with another simulation for the present climate condition. The global total emission flux of soil dust aerosols at the LGM is simulated to be about 2.4 times as large as that in the present climate, and the simulated deposition flux is in general agreement with estimations from ice core and marine sediment samplings though it appears to be underestimated over the Antarctic. The calculated direct radiative forcings of soil dust aerosols at the LGM is close to zero at the tropopause and {\&}minus;0.4 W m{\&}minus;2 at the surface. These radiative forcings are about twice as large as those in the present climate. SPRINTARS also includes the microphysical parameterizations of the cloud-aerosol interaction both for liquid water and ice crystals, which affect the radiation budget. The positive radiative forcing from the indirect effect of soil dust aerosols is mainly caused by their properties to act as ice nuclei. This effect is simulated to be smaller ({\&}minus;0.9 W m{\&}minus;2) at the LGM than in the present. It is suggested that atmospheric dust might contribute to the cold climate during the glacial periods both through the direct and indirect effects, relative to the interglacial periods. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {Simulations of the most recent 100 kyr glaciation-deglaciation cycle of the late Pleistocene Ice Age are presented which feature a newly constructed thermomechanically coupled three-dimensional ice sheet model which is itself coupled to a previously employed global energy balance climate model with realistic geography. The model incorporates both orbital insolation forcing due to the slow time evolution of orbital geometry (arising from many body effects in the solar system) as well as the forcing due to varying atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Simulations of the Greenland ice sheet are presented with which we are able to investigate the extent to which the ice flow law employed in the ice dynamics component of the model is constrained. The good agreement that we are able to achieve between the model-generated ice sheet topography and the observed Greenland topography provides a clear demonstration of the quality of the ice dynamical model we have developed. The incorporation of full thermomechanical coupling using the standard Glen flow law in the ice dynamics component of the model is shown to increase the difficulty of achieving complete termination of the 100 kyr cycle that the model delivers. Furthermore, a 20 fold flow parameter enhancement relative to that used for Greenland is required to match the aspect ratio of the ICE-4G reconstruction [Peltier, 1994]. Analyses presented herein suggest that basal processes are unlikely to account for this need for flow parameter retuning. However, the new thermomechanically coupled model now provides a clear separation of the Cordilleran and Hudson Bay domes at Last Glacial Maximum in contradistinction to analyses previously performed with isothermal ice sheet models. This innovation therefore leads to a major improvement of the generated ice sheet topography in relation to geological inferences. Aside from this important difference, the overall results regarding the ability of the model to fully account for the most recent 100 kyr cycle of glaciation and deglaciation without the necessity of introducing additional ad hoc feedbacks confirms the validity of this conclusion, reached previously on the basis of isothermal model integrations.

abstract = {We examine the extent to which observations from the Greenland ice sheet combined with three-dimensional dynamical ice sheet models and semi-Lagrangian tracer methods can be used to constrain inferences of the Eemian evolution of the ice sheet, of the extent and frequency of summit migration during the 100 kyr ice age cycle, and of the deep geothermal flux of heat from the Earth into the base of the ice sheet. Relative sea level, present-day surface geometry, basal temperature, and age and temperature profiles from the Greenland Ice Project (GRIP) are imposed as constraints to tune ice sheet model and climate forcing parameters. Despite the paucity of observations, model-based inferences suggest a significant northeast gradient in geothermal heat flux. Our analyses also suggest that during the glacial cycle, the contemporaneous summit only occupied the present-day location during interglacial periods. On the basis of the development and use of a high- resolution semi-Lagrangian tracer analysis methodology for ?18O, we rule out isotropic flow disturbances due to summit migration as a possible source of the high Eemian variability of the GRIP ?18O record. Finally, in contrast with results obtained in some recent attempts to infer the extent to which Greenland may have contributed to the anomalous highstand of Eemian sea level, we find that conservative bounds for this contribution are 2-5.2 m, with a more likely range of 2.7-4.5 m.},

In the present paper, simulated mean climate, internal climate variability, and climate sensitivity in MIROC6 are evaluated and briefly summarized in comparison with the previous version of our climate model (MIROC5) and observations. The results show that the overall reproducibility of mean climate and internal climate variability in MIROC6 is better than that in MIROC5. The tropical climate systems (e.g., summertime precipitation in the western Pacific and the eastward-propagating Madden-Julian oscillation) and the midlatitude atmospheric circulation (e.g., the westerlies, the polar night jet, and troposphere-stratosphere interactions) are significantly improved in MIROC6. These improvements can be attributed to the newly implemented parameterization for shallow convective processes and to the inclusion of the stratosphere. While there are significant differences in climates and variabilities between the two models, the effective climate sensitivity of 2.6K remains the same because the differences in radiative forcing and climate feedback tend to offset each other. With an aim towards contributing to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, designated simulations tackling a wide range of climate science issues, as well as seasonal to decadal climate predictions and future climate projections, are currently ongoing using MIROC6.},

Aerosol results from nudged and free-running simulations for the 10-year period 2003 to 2012 are compared to various measurements of aerosol properties. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall in terms of aerosol optical thickness, but may underestimate coarse-mode aerosol concentrations to some extent so that the modeled particles are smaller than indicated by the observations. Sulfate aerosol measurements in the US and Europe are reproduced well by the model, while carbonaceous aerosol species are biased low.

In this study, 1D and 2D scale-selective filters have been implemented using a convolution-based scheme, since a convolution can be readily evaluated in terms of CCAM's native conformal cubic coordinates. The downscaling accuracy of 1D and 2D scale-selective filters is evaluated after downscaling NCEP Global Forecast System analyses for 2006 from 200-km resolution to 60-km resolution over Australia. The 1D scale-selective filter scheme was found to downscale the analyses with similar accuracy to a 2D filter but required significantly fewer computations. The 1D and 2D scale-selective filters were also found to downscale the analyses more accurately than a far-field nudging scheme (i.e., analogous to a boundary-value nudging approach). It is concluded that when the model is required to reproduce the host model behavior above a specified length scale then the use of an appropriately designed 1D scale-selective filter can be a computationally efficient approach to dynamical downscaling for models having a cube-based geometry. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The recently developed Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) is employed for simulations contributing to the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) experiments and the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5). In this manuscript, we focus on evaluating the ocean and land carbon cycle components of the NorESM, based on the preindustrial control and historical simulations. Many of the observed large scale ocean biogeochemical features are reproduced satisfactorily by the NorESM. When compared to the climatological estimates from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA), the model simulated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and phosphate distributions agree reasonably well in both the surface layer and deep water structure. However, the model simulates a relatively strong overturning circulation strength that leads to noticeable model-data bias, especially within the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This strong overturning circulation slightly distorts the structure of the biogeochemical tracers at depth. Advancements in simulating the oceanic mixed layer depth with respect to the previous generation model particularly improve the surface tracer distribution as well as the upper ocean biogeochemical processes, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, near-surface ocean processes such as biological production and air-sea gas exchange, are in good agreement with climatological observations. The NorESM adopts the same terrestrial model as the Community Earth System Model (CESM1). It reproduces the general pattern of landvegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) when compared to the observationally based values derived from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers. While the model simulates well the vegetation carbon pool, the soil carbon pool is smaller by a factor of three relative to the observational based estimates. The simulated annual mean terrestrial GPP and total respiration are slightly larger than observed, but the difference between the global GPP and respiration is comparable. Model-data bias in GPP is mainly simulated in the tropics (overestimation) and in high latitudes (underestimation). Within the NorESM framework, both the ocean and terrestrial carbon cycle models simulate a steady increase in carbon uptake from the preindustrial period to the presentday. The land carbon uptake is noticeably smaller than the observations, which is attributed to the strong nitrogen limitation formulated by the land model.},

abstract = {The ocean carbon cycle is a key player in the climate system through its role in regulating the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and other processes that alter the Earth's radiative balance. In the second version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2), the oceanic carbon cycle component has gone through numerous updates that include, amongst others, improved process representations, increased interactions with the atmosphere, and additional new tracers. Oceanic dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is now prognostically simulated and its fluxes are directly coupled with the atmospheric component, leading to a direct feedback to the climate. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and additional riverine inputs of other biogeochemical tracers have recently been included in the model. The implementation of new tracers such as "preformed" and "natural" tracers enables a separation of physical from biogeochemical drivers as well as of internal from external forcings and hence a better diagnostic of the simulated biogeochemical variability. Carbon isotope tracers have been implemented and will be relevant for studying long-term past climate changes. Here, we describe these new model implementations and present an evaluation of the model's performance in simulating the observed climatological states of water-column biogeochemistry and in simulating transient evolution over the historical period. Compared to its predecessor NorESM1, the new model's performance has improved considerably in many aspects. In the interior, the observed spatial patterns of nutrients, oxygen, and carbon chemistry are better reproduced, reducing the overall model biases. A new set of ecosystem parameters and improved mixed layer dynamics improve the representation of upper-ocean processes (biological production and air-sea CO2 fluxes) at seasonal timescale. Transient warming and air-sea CO2 fluxes over the historical period are also in good agreement with observation-based estimates. NorESM2 participates in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) through DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and several endorsed MIP simulations.},

abstract = {To allow for climate impact studies on human and natural systems, high-resolution climate information is needed. Over some parts of the world plenty of regional climate simulations have been carried out, while in other regions hardly any high-resolution climate information is available. The CORDEX Central Asia domain is one of these regions, and this article describes the evaluation for two regional climate models (RCMs), REMO and ALARO-0, that were run for the first time at a horizontal resolution of 0.22° (25 km) over this region. The output of the ERA-Interim-driven RCMs is compared with different observational datasets over the 1980-2017 period. REMO scores better for temperature, whereas the ALARO-0 model prevails for precipitation. Studying specific subregions provides deeper insight into the strengths and weaknesses of both RCMs over the CAS-CORDEX domain. For example, ALARO-0 has difficulties in simulating the temperature over the northern part of the domain, particularly when snow cover is present, while REMO poorly simulates the annual cycle of precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. The evaluation of minimum and maximum temperature demonstrates that both models underestimate the daily temperature range. This study aims to evaluate whether REMO and ALARO-0 provide reliable climate information over the CAS-CORDEX domain for impact modeling and environmental assessment applications. Depending on the evaluated season and variable, it is demonstrated that the produced climate data can be used in several subregions, e.g., temperature and precipitation over western Central Asia in autumn. At the same time, a bias adjustment is required for regions where significant biases have been identified.},

abstract = {The data volume produced by regional and global multicomponent Earth system models is rapidly increasing because of the improved spatial and temporal resolution of the model components and the sophistication of the numerical models regarding represented physical processes and their complex non-linear interactions. In particular, very small time steps need to be defined in non-hydrostatic high-resolution modeling applications to represent the evolution of the fast-moving processes such as turbulence, extratropical cyclones, convective lines, jet streams, internal waves, vertical turbulent mixing and surface gravity waves. Consequently, the employed small time steps cause extra computation and disk input-output overhead in the modeling system even if today's most powerful high-performance computing and data storage systems are considered. Analysis of the high volume of data from multiple Earth system model components at different temporal and spatial resolutions also poses a challenging problem to efficiently perform integrated data analysis of the massive amounts of data when relying on the traditional postprocessing methods today. This study mainly aims to explore the feasibility and added value of integrating existing in situ visualization and data analysis methods within the model coupling framework. The objective is to increase interoperability between Earth system multicomponent code and data-processing systems by providing an easy-to-use, efficient, generic and standardized modeling environment. The new data analysis approach enables simultaneous analysis of the vast amount of data produced by multicomponent regional Earth system models during the runtime. The presented methodology also aims to create an integrated modeling environment for analyzing fast-moving processes and their evolution both in time and space to support a better understanding of the underplaying physical mechanisms. The state-of-the-art approach can also be employed to solve common problems in the model development cycle, e.g., designing a new subgrid-scale parameterization that requires inspecting the integrated model behavior at a higher temporal and spatial scale simultaneously and supporting visual debugging of the multicomponent modeling systems, which usually are not facilitated by existing model coupling libraries and modeling systems.},

abstract = {Recently, major progress has been made in the simulation of the ocean dynamics of the Mediterranean using atmospheric and oceanic models with high spatial resolution. High resolution is essential to accurately capture the synoptic variability required to initiate intermediate- and deep-water formation, the engine of the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation (MTC). In paleoclimate studies, one major problem with the simulation of regional climate changes is that boundary conditions are not available from observations or data reconstruction to drive high-resolution regional models. One consistent way to advance paleoclimate modelling is to use a comprehensive global-to-regional approach. However, this approach needs long-term integration to reach equilibrium (hundreds of years), implying enormous computational resources. To tackle this issue, a sequential architecture of a global-regional modelling platform has been developed for the first time and is described in detail in this paper. First of all, the platform is validated for the historical period. It is then used to investigate the climate and in particular, the oceanic circulation, during the Early Holocene. This period was characterised by a large reorganisation of the MTC that strongly affected oxygen supply to the intermediate and deep waters, which ultimately led to an anoxic crisis (called sapropel). Beyond the case study shown here, this platform may be applied to a large number of paleoclimate contexts from the Quaternary to the Pliocene, as long as regional tectonics remain mostly unchanged. For example, the climate responses of the Mediterranean basin during the last interglacial period (LIG), the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Late Pliocene all present interesting scientific challenges which may be addressed using this numerical platform.},

A high resolution general circulation model (ECHAM4 T106) is used to estimate temperature and precipitation changes for a doubled CO2 climate and serves as input for the glacier model. Volume-area relations are used to take into account the reduction of glacier area resulting from greenhouse warming. Each glacieriated region has a specified glacier size distribution, defined by the number of glaciers in a size class and a mean area. Changes in glacier volume are calculated by a precipitation dependent mass balance sensitivity. The model predicts a global sea level rise of 57 mm over a period of 70 years. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 0.86 mm yr-1K-1. Assuming a constant glacier area as done in earlier work leads to an overestimation of 19{\%} for the contribution to sea level rise.},

abstract = {A new surface scheme is introduced in the upcoming ecmwf global reanalysis covering a 40-year period 1957-1997 (known as era-40). The new scheme is characterized by a tiled treatment of subgrid fractions of evaporating surfaces, the use of a global vegetation database plus an associated set of model parameters, and changes into the parameterization of snow processes, the coupling of the skin layer to the soil, and the vertical soil moisture transport. Parallel to the evaluation of the global impact in the ecmwf 3D model, this tiled scheme was tested in offline mode with data from 7 long term surface field campaigns. The datasets cover a wide range of climate regions and surface land use and vegetation types, ranging from boreal (Boreas), tropical (Arme) and temperate (Garderen) forest, via savannah (Sebex) and prairie (Fife) to crop (Hapex-Mobilhy) and grassland (Cabauw). The offline evaluation was primarily used for validation purposes, but gave also rise to adjusting parameter settings and/or parameterization approaches. After the combined calibration/validation exercise we can conclude that (a) the description of snow processes and surface fluxes in the Boreal areas has improved significantly, (b) the tiling approach does not give rise to major changes in the model correspondence to data in case of grass- and cropland, and (c) model performance becomes increasingly dependent on a proper choice of vegetation dependent model parameters, which gives rise to an increased number of degrees of freedom.},

We present an overview of the TM5 model and the two-way data exchange between TM5 and the IFS model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the atmospheric general circulation model of EC-Earth. In this paper we evaluate the simulation of tropospheric chemistry and aerosols in a oneway coupled configuration. We have carried out a decadal simulation for present-day conditions and calculated chemical budgets and climatologies of tracer concentrations and aerosol optical depth. For comparison we have also performed offline simulations driven by meteorological fields from ECMWF's ERA-Interim reanalysis and output from the EC-Earth model itself. Compared to the offline simulations, the online-coupled system produces more efficient vertical mixing in the troposphere, which reflects an improvement of the treatment of cumulus convection. The chemistry in the EC-Earth simulations is affected by the fact that the current version of EC-Earth produces a cold bias with too dry air in large parts of the troposphere. Compared to the ERA-Interim driven simulation, the oxidizing capacity in EC-Earth is lower in the tropics and higher in the extratropics. The atmospheric lifetime of methane in EC-Earth is 9.4 years, which is 7{\%} longer than the lifetime obtained with ERA-Interim but remains well within the range reported in the literature. We further evaluate the model by comparing the simulated climatologies of surface radon-222 and carbon monoxide, tropospheric and surface ozone, and aerosol optical depth against observational data. The work presented in this study is the first step in the development of EC-Earth into an Earth system model with fully interactive atmospheric chemistry and aerosols.},

EC-Earth3-AerChem has interactive aerosols and atmospheric chemistry and contributes to the Aerosols and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). In this paper, we give an overview of the model, describe in detail how it differs from the other EC-Earth3 configurations, and outline the new features compared with the previously documented version of the model (EC-Earth 2.4). We explain how the model was tuned and spun up under preindustrial conditions and characterize the model's general performance on the basis of a selection of coupled simulations conducted for CMIP6. The net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere in the preindustrial control simulation is on average -0.09 W m-2 with a standard deviation due to interannual variability of 0.25 W m-2, showing no significant drift. The global surface air temperature in the simulation is on average 14.08 ∼ C with an interannual standard deviation of 0.17 ∼ C, exhibiting a small drift of 0.015 ± 0.005 ∼ C per century. The model's effective equilibrium climate sensitivity is estimated at 3.9 ∼ C, and its transient climate response is estimated at 2.1 ∼ C. The CMIP6 historical simulation displays spurious interdecadal variability in Northern Hemisphere temperatures, resulting in a large spread across ensemble members and a tendency to underestimate observed annual surface temperature anomalies from the early 20th century onwards. The observed warming of the Southern Hemisphere is well reproduced by the model. Compared with the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), the surface air temperature climatology for 1995-2014 has an average bias of -0.86 ± 0.05 ∼ C with a standard deviation across ensemble members of 0.35 ∼ C in the Northern Hemisphere and 1.29 ± 0.02 ∼ C with a corresponding standard deviation of 0.05 ∼ C in the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere warm bias is largely caused by errors in shortwave cloud radiative effects over the Southern Ocean, a deficiency of many climate models. Changes in the emissions of near-term climate forcers (NTCFs) have significant effects on the global climate from the second half of the 20th century onwards. For the SSP3-7.0 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, the model gives a global warming at the end of the 21st century (2091-2100) of 4.9 ∼ C above the preindustrial mean. A 0.5 ∼ C stronger warming is obtained for the AerChemMIP scenario with reduced emissions of NTCFs. With concurrent reductions of future methane concentrations, the warming is projected to be reduced by 0.5 ∼ C.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the development process and main characteristics of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), a set of four new pathways developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for long-term and near-term modeling experiments. The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i. e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 × 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {In the companion to the present paper, the soil model associated with CLASS (Canadian Land Surface Scheme) was outlined. In this paper, the accompanying vegetation model is described. This model includes physically based treatment of energy and moisture fluxes from the canopy as well as radiation and precipitation cascades through it, and incorporates explicit thermal separation of the vegetation from the underlying ground. Seasonal variations of canopy parameters are accounted for. The morphological characteristics of the ‘composite canopy' associated with each grid square are calculated as weighted averages over the vegetation types present. Each grid square is divided into a maximum of four separate subareas: bare soil, snow‐covered, vegetation‐covered, and snow‐and‐vegetation covered. Test runs were done in coupled mode with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM, to evaluate the performance of CLASS compared with that of the simpler land surface scheme previously used. Two versions of CLASS were run: one with ponded surface water saved between time steps, and one with it discarded. For the seasons of June—July—August and December—January—February, diagnostic calculations showed that the old scheme underestimated the globally averaged land surface screen temperature by as much as 3.0°C, and overestimated the globally averaged precipitation rate over land by up to 1.0 mm day−1. CLASS, on the other hand, produced screen temperature anomalies, varying in sign, of 0.2–0.3°C, and positive precipitation anomalies of 0.6–0.7 mm day−1. The relatively poor performance of the old model was attributed to its neglect of vegetation stomatal resistance, its assumption that the contents of the soil moisture ‘bucket' had to be completely frozen before the surface temperature could fall below 0°C, and its use of the force‐restore method for soil temperatures, which systematically neglects long‐term thermal forcing from the soil substrate. The assumption made in most GCMs that excess surface water immediately becomes overland runoff is shown to result in substantial overestimates of surface screen temperatures in continental interiors.

abstract = {The Canadian Land Surface Scheme “CLASS” was developed in the late 1980s for the Canadian GCM, in response to the perceived need for a “second-generation “ land surface model which would adequately treat the effects of vegetation, snow and soil on exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere. CLASS has been tested both in coupled mode with the GCM and in various experiments that have been carried out in conjunction with PILPS, the international Project for Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes. In the context of those runs, CLASS has been shown to perform quite -well. However, it is recognized that a more rigorous framework of testing against field data is required before the model can be used with confidence for studies involving the scaling up of surface fluxes, or the modelling of severely heterogeneous landscapes. The series of papers which follows (to which this one provides an introductory overview) describes the testing of CLASS against a wide variety of micrometeorological dataseis, and the model development that has proceeded alongside this work, under the auspices of the Canadian Climate Research Network, from 1994 to 1997. The highlights of this research include the development of new algorithms for bare soil evaporation; forest transpiration; heat and moisture transfers in organic soils; and regional-scale river routing. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper describes the main characteristics of CNRM-CM6-1, the fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model of sixth generation jointly developed by Centre National de Recherches M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologiques (CNRM) and Cerfacs for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The paper provides a description of each component of CNRM-CM6-1, including the coupling method and the new online output software. We emphasize where model's components have been updated with respect to the former model version, CNRM-CM5.1. In particular, we highlight major improvements in the representation of atmospheric and land processes. A particular attention has also been devoted to mass and energy conservation in the simulated climate system to limit long-term drifts. The climate simulated by CNRM-CM6-1 is then evaluated using CMIP6 historical and Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments in comparison with CMIP5 CNRM-CM5.1 equivalent experiments. Overall, the mean surface biases are of similar magnitude but with different spatial patterns. Deep ocean biases are generally reduced, whereas sea ice is too thin in the Arctic. Although the simulated climate variability remains roughly consistent with CNRM-CM5.1, its sensitivity to rising CO2 has increased: the equilibrium climate sensitivity is 4.9 K, which is now close to the upper bound of the range estimated from CMIP5 models.},

The most important changes with respect to the previous version (INMCM4) were made in the atmospheric component of the model. Its vertical resolution was increased to resolve the upper stratosphere and the lower mesosphere. A more sophisticated parameterization of condensation and cloudiness formation was introduced as well. An aerosol module was incorporated into the model. The upgraded oceanic component has a modified dynamical core optimized for better implementation on parallel computers and has two times higher resolution in both horizontal directions. Analysis of the present-day climatology of the INMCM5 (based on the data of historical run for 1979–2005) shows moderate improvements in reproduction of basic circulation characteristics with respect to the previous version. Biases in the near-surface temperature and precipitation are slightly reduced compared with INMCM4 as well as biases in oceanic temperature, salinity and sea surface height. The most notable improvement over INMCM4 is the capability of the new model to reproduce the equatorial stratospheric quasi-biannual oscillation and statistics of sudden stratospheric warmings.},

abstract = {The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) has developed the fourth generation of the Canadian Atmospheric Global Climate Model (CanAM4). The new model includes substantially modified physical parameterizations compared to its predecessor. In particular, the treatment of clouds, cloud radiative effects, and precipitation has been modified. Aerosol direct and indirect effects are calculated based on a bulk aerosol scheme. Simulation results for present-day global climate are analyzed, with a focus on cloud radiative effects and precipitation. Good overall agreement is found between climatological mean short- and longwave cloud radiative effects and observations from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) experiment. An analysis of the responses of cloud radiative effects to variations in climate will be presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {The new Energy Exascale Earth System Model Version 1 (E3SMv1) developed for the U.S. Department of Energy has significant new treatments of aerosols and light-absorbing snow impurities as well as their interactions with clouds and radiation. This study describes seven sets of new aerosol-related treatments (involving emissions, new particle formation, aerosol transport, wet scavenging and resuspension, and snow radiative transfer) and examines how they affect global aerosols and radiative forcing in E3SMv1. Altogether, they give a reduced total aerosol radiative forcing (−1.6 W/m2) and sensitivity in cloud liquid water to aerosols, but an increased sensitivity in cloud droplet size to aerosols. A new approach for H2SO4 production and loss largely reduces a low bias in small particles concentrations and leads to substantial increases in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations and cloud radiative cooling. Emitting secondary organic aerosol precursor gases from elevated sources increases the column burden of secondary organic aerosol, contributing substantially to global clear-sky aerosol radiative cooling (−0.15 out of −0.5 W/m2). A new treatment of aerosol resuspension from evaporating precipitation, developed to remedy two shortcomings of the original treatment, produces a modest reduction in aerosols and cloud droplets; its impact depends strongly on the model physics and is much stronger in E3SM Version 0. New treatments of the mixing state and optical properties of snow impurities and snow grains introduce a positive present-day shortwave radiative forcing (0.26 W/m2), but changes in aerosol transport and wet removal processes also affect the concentration and radiative forcing of light-absorbing impurities in snow/ice.},

Among other applications, GC3 is the basis of the United Kingdom's submission to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). This paper documents the model components that make up the configuration (although the scientific descriptions of these components are in companion papers) and details the coupling between them. The performance of GC3 is assessed in terms of mean biases and variability in long climate simulations using present-day forcing. The suitability of the configuration for predictability on shorter time scales (weather and seasonal forecasting) is also briefly discussed. The performance of GC3 is compared against GC2, the previous Met Office coupled model configuration, and against an older configuration (HadGEM2-AO) which was the submission to CMIP5. In many respects, the performance of GC3 is comparable with GC2, however, there is a notable improvement in the Southern Ocean warm sea surface temperature bias which has been reduced by 75{\%}, and there are improvements in cloud amount and some aspects of tropical variability. Relative to HadGEM2-AO, many aspects of the present-day climate are improved in GC3 including tropospheric and stratospheric temperature structure, most aspects of tropical and extratropical variability and top-of-atmosphere and surface fluxes. A number of outstanding errors are identified including a residual asymmetric sea surface temperature bias (cool northern hemisphere, warm Southern Ocean), an overly strong global hydrological cycle and insufficient European blocking.},

abstract = {Understanding future changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle is important for reliable projections of climate change and impacts on ecosystems. It is well known that nitrogen (N) could limit plants' response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and it is therefore important to include a representation of the N cycle in Earth system models. Here we present the implementation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES)-the land surface scheme of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). Two configurations are discussed-the first one (JULES-CN) has a bulk soil biogeochemical model and the second one is a development configuration that resolves the soil biogeochemistry with depth (JULES-CNlayer). In JULES the nitrogen (N) cycle is based on the existing carbon (C) cycle and represents all the key terrestrial N processes in a parsimonious way. Biological N fixation is dependent on net primary productivity, and N deposition is specified as an external input. Nitrogen leaves the vegetation and soil system via leaching and a bulk gas loss term. Nutrient limitation reduces carbon-use efficiency (CUE-ratio of net to gross primary productivity) and can slow soil decomposition. We show that ecosystem level N limitation of net primary productivity (quantified in the model by the ratio of the potential amount of C that can be allocated to growth and spreading of the vegetation compared with the actual amount achieved in its natural state) falls at the lower end of the observational estimates in forests (approximately 1.0 in the model compared with 1.01 to 1.38 in the observations). The model shows more N limitation in the tropical savanna and tundra biomes, consistent with the available observations. Simulated C and N pools and fluxes are comparable to the limited available observations and model-derived estimates. The introduction of an N cycle improves the representation of interannual variability of global net ecosystem exchange, which was more pronounced in the C-cycle-only versions of JULES (JULES-C) than shown in estimates from the Global Carbon Project. It also reduces the present-day CUE from a global mean value of 0.45 for JULES-C to 0.41 for JULES-CN and 0.40 for JULES-CNlayer, all of which fall within the observational range. The N cycle also alters the response of the C fluxes over the 20th century and limits the CO2 fertilisation effect, such that the simulated current-day land C sink is reduced by about 0.5 Pg C yr-1 compared to the version with no N limitation. JULES-CNlayer additionally improves the representation of soil biogeochemistry, includ ing turnover times in the northern high latitudes. The inclu sion of a prognostic land N scheme marks a step forward in functionality and realism for the JULES and UKESM mod els.},

abstract = {We present the Potsdam Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM-PIK), developed at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to be used for simulations of large-scale ice sheet-shelf systems. It is derived from the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (Bueler and Brown, 2009). Velocities are calculated by superposition of two shallow stress balance approximations within the entire ice covered region: the shallow ice approximation (SIA) is dominant in grounded regions and accounts for shear deformation parallel to the geoid. The plug-flow type shallow shelf approximation (SSA) dominates the velocity field in ice shelf regions and serves as a basal sliding velocity in grounded regions. Ice streams can be identified diagnostically as regions with a significant contribution of membrane stresses to the local momentum balance. All lateral boundaries in PISM-PIK are free to evolve, including the grounding line and ice fronts. Ice shelf margins in particular are modeled using Neumann boundary conditions for the SSA equations, reflecting a hydrostatic stress imbalance along the vertical calving face. The ice front position is modeled using a subgrid-scale representation of calving front motion (Albrecht et al., 2011) and a physically-motivated calving law based on horizontal spreading rates. The model is tested in experiments from the Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP). A dynamic equilibrium simulation of Antarctica under present-day conditions is presented in Martin et al. (2011). {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

Historical simulations from 1851 to 2014 from BCC-CSM2-MR (CMIP6) and from 1851 to 2005 from BCC-CSM1.1m (CMIP5) are used for models assessment. The evaluation matrices include the following: (a) the energy budget at top-of-atmosphere; (b) surface air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation for the global and East Asia regions; (c) the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Pacific; (d) sea-ice extent and thickness and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC); and (e) climate variations at different timescales, such as the global warming trend in the 20th century, the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the diurnal cycle of precipitation. Compared with BCC-CSM1.1m, BCC-CSM2-MR shows significant improvements in many aspects including the tropospheric air temperature and circulation at global and regional scales in East Asia and climate variability at different timescales, such as the QBO, the MJO, the diurnal cycle of precipitation, interannual variations of SST in the equatorial Pacific, and the long-term trend of surface air temperature.},

abstract = {BCC-CSM2-HR is a high-resolution version of the Beijing Climate Center (BCC) Climate System Model (T266 in the atmosphere and 1=4 latitude1=4 longitude in the ocean). Its development is on the basis of the mediumresolution version BCC-CSM2-MR (T106 in the atmosphere and 1 latitude1 longitude in the ocean) which is the baseline for BCC participation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). This study documents the high-resolution model, highlights major improvements in the representation of atmospheric dynamical core and physical processes. BCC-CSM2-HR is evaluated for historical climate simulations from 1950 to 2014, performed under CMIP6-prescribed historical forcing, in comparison with its previous medium-resolution version BCC-CSM2-MR. Observed global warming trends of surface air temperature from 1950 to 2014 are well captured by both BCC-CSM2-MR and BCC-CSM2-HR. Present-day basic atmospheric mean states during the period from 1995 to 2014 are then evaluated at global scale, followed by an assessment on climate variabilities in the tropics including the tropical cyclones (TCs), the El Ni o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the stratosphere. It is shown that BCC-CSM2-HR represents the global energy balance well and can realistically reproduce the main patterns of atmospheric temperature and wind, precipitation, land surface air temperature, and sea surface temperature (SST). It also improves the spatial patterns of sea ice and associated seasonal variations in both hemispheres. The bias of the double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), obvious in BCC-CSM2-MR, almost disappears in BCC-CSM2-HR. TC activity in the tropics is increased with resolution enhanced. The cycle of ENSO, the eastward propagative feature and convection intensity ofMJO, and the downward propagation of QBO in BCC-CSM2-HR are all in a better agreement with observations than their counterparts in BCC-CSM2-MR. Some imperfections are, however, noted in BCC-CSM2-HR, such as the excessive cloudiness in the eastern basin of the tropical Pacific with cold SST biases and the insufficient number of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic.},

abstract = {The Beijing Climate Center Earth System Model version 1 (BCC-ESM1) is the first version of a fully coupled Earth system model with interactive atmospheric chemistry and aerosols developed by the Beijing Climate Center, China Meteorological Administration. Major aerosol species (including sulfate, organic carbon, black carbon, dust, and sea salt) and greenhouse gases are interactively simulated with a whole panoply of processes controlling emission, transport, gas-phase chemical reactions, secondary aerosol formation, gravitational settling, dry deposition, and wet scavenging by clouds and precipitation. Effects of aerosols on radiation, cloud, and precipitation are fully treated. The performance of BCC-ESM1 in simulating aerosols and their optical properties is comprehensively evaluated as required by the Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP), covering the preindustrial mean state and time evolution from 1850 to 2014. The simulated aerosols from BCC-ESM1 are quite coherent with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)-recommended data, in situ measurements from surface networks (such as IMPROVE in the US and EMEP in Europe), and aircraft observations. A comparison of modeled aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550{\&}thinsp;nm with satellite observations retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and surface AOD observations from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) shows reasonable agreement between simulated and observed AOD. However, BCC-ESM1 shows weaker upward transport of aerosols from the surface to the middle and upper troposphere, likely reflecting the deficiency of representing deep convective transport of chemical species in BCC-ESM1. With an overall good agreement between BCC-ESM1 simulated and observed aerosol properties, it demonstrates a success of the implementation of interactive aerosol and atmospheric chemistry in BCC-ESM1.},

abstract = {Human water regulation, groundwater lateral flow, and the movement of frost and thaw fronts (FTFs) affect soil water and thermal processes, as well as energy and water exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere. Reasonable representation of these processes in land surface models is very important to improving the understanding of land-atmosphere interactions. In this study, mathematical descriptions of groundwater lateral flow, human water regulation, and FTFs were synchronously incorporated into a high-resolution community land model, which is then named the Land Surface Model for Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS-LSM). With a series of atmospheric forcings and high-resolution land surface data from the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) program, numerical simulations of the period 1981–2013 using CAS-LSM with 1-km resolution were conducted for an endorheic basin, the Heihe River Basin in China. Compared with observations, CAS-LSM reproduced the distributions of groundwater, evapotranspiration, and permafrost reasonably and well matched the temporal changes in ground temperature, heat fluxes, and FTFs. Results illuminate the temporal and spatial characteristics of frozen soil and the changes in the land-atmosphere exchange of carbon, water, and energy. The permafrost and seasonally frozen soil were distinguished. In the seasonally frozen areas, the maximum soil frost depth increased by 0.65 mm/year within natural areas and decreased by 2.12 mm/year in human-dominated areas. The active layer thickness increased 8.63 mm/year for permafrost. In the permafrost zone evapotranspiration and latent heat flux increased, and the sensible heat flux declined. In the human-dominated areas water use raised the latent heat flux and reduced the sensible heat flux, net ecosystem exchange, and streamflow recharging to the eco-fragile region in the lower reaches. Results suggested that the land surface model CAS-LSM is a potential tool for studying land surface processes, especially in cold and arid regions experiencing human interventions.},

abstract = {This paper completes a series of studies conducted with a numerical model of low spatial resolution for the area of the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean north of 65° N without including Hudson Bay to reproduce the monthly mean state in 1948-2002. The paper gives a detailed description of the physical formulation of the problem, the approximations and parametrizations that were employed, and the parameters of atmospheric and oceanic external forcings. Generally, the author follows the requirements of the protocol of the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP). The paper analyzes the main monthly mean characteristics: ice thickness, ice-drift velocity, snow thickness, velocity of currents, and temperature and salinity, which were derived as multiyear averages over 1958-2002. A good reproduction of the following sea-ice characteristics is noted: ice thickness, propagation area, ice concentration, and drift velocity. For example, the annual mean ice-drift velocity is about 3.33 cm/s, which is consistent with the data obtained from drifting buoys, which yield an annual mean ice-drift velocity of 3.65 cm/s. At the same time, there are problems of reproducing the observed snow-thickness distribution. The use of parametrizations of horizontal turbulence of the Neptune-Effect type and eddy transfer for a scalar makes it possible to conserve the cyclonic circulation in the Atlantic water layer although the low spatial resolution gives no way of explicitly reproducing the narrow topographic jet. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the main unsolved problems and, primarily, the problem of reproducing the freshwater content. The model and further versions of it will be used in the European Commission project DAMOCLES (Developing Arctic Modeling and Observing Capabilities for Long-Term Environmental Studies) to assess the sensitivity of the Arctic Ocean to the parameters of external forcing and to evaluate the role of tides in the formation of the Arctic Ocean's climate. {\textcopyright} Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2009.},

abstract = {A new global climate model, MRI-CGCM3, has been developed at the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI). This model is an overall upgrade of MRI's former climate model MRI-CGCM2 series. MRI-CGCM3 is composed of atmosphere-land, aerosol, and ocean-ice models, and is a subset of the MRI's earth system model MRI-ESM1. Atmospheric component MRI-AGCM3 is interactively coupled with aerosol model to represent direct and indirect e{\{}currency sign{\}}ects of aerosols with a new cloud microphysics scheme. Basic experiments for pre-industrial control, historical and climate sensitivity are performed with MRI-CGCM3. In the pre-industrial control experiment, the model exhibits very stable behavior without climatic drifts, at least in the radiation budget, the temperature near the surface and the major indices of ocean circulations. The sea surface temperature (SST) drift is sufficiently small, while there is a 1 W m -2 heating imbalance at the surface. The model's climate sensitivity is estimated to be 2.11 K with Gregory's method. The transient climate response (TCR) to 1 {\%} yr -1 increase of carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration is 1.6 K with doubling of CO 2 concentration and 4.1 K with quadrupling of CO 2 concentration. The simulated present-day mean climate in the historical experiment is evaluated by comparison with observations, including reanalysis. The model reproduces the overall mean climate, including seasonal variation in various aspects in the atmosphere and the oceans. Variability in the simulated climate is also evaluated and is found to be realistic, including El Nin ̃o and Southern Oscillation and the Arctic and Antarctic oscillations. However, some important issues are identified. The simulated SST indicates generally cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and warm bias in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and the simulated sea ice expands excessively in the North Atlantic in winter.

abstract = {The new Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model version 2.0 (MRI-ESM2.0) has been developed based on previous models, MRI-CGCM3 and MRI-ESM1, which participated in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). These models underwent numerous improvements meant for highly accurate climate reproducibility. This paper describes model formulation updates and evaluates basic performance of its physical components. The new model has nominal horizontal resolutions of 100 km for atmosphere and ocean components, similar to the previous models. The atmospheric vertical resolution is 80 layers, which is enhanced from the 48 layers of its predecessor. Accumulation of various improvements concerning clouds, such as a new stratocumulus cloud scheme, led to remarkable reduction in errors in shortwave, longwave, and net radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The resulting errors are sufficiently small compared with those in the CMIP5 models. The improved radiation distribution brings the accurate meridional heat transport required for the ocean and contributes to a reduced surface air temperature (SAT) bias. MRI-ESM2.0 displays realistic reproduction of both mean climate and interannual variability. For instance, the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation can now be realistically expressed through the enhanced vertical resolution and introduction of non-orographic gravity wave drag parameterization. For the historical experiment, MRI-ESM2.0 reasonably reproduces global SAT change for recent decades; however, cooling in the 1950s through the 1960s and warming afterward are overestimated compared with observations. MRI-ESM2.0 has been improved in many aspects over the previous models, MRICGCM3 and MRI-ESM1, and is expected to demonstrate superior performance in many experiments planned for CMIP6.},

abstract = {The problem of mathematical modelling of the baroclinic dynamics of the World Ocean and its large areas is considered. The mathematical model has been developed at the Institute of Numerical Mathematics RAS (INMRAS) and is based on the equations of general circulation represented in the generalized $\sigma$-system of coordinates with a free surface in the hydrostatics and Boussinesq approximation. The computational solution technique for this problem is based on multicomponent splitting and has a flexible, hierarchically scalable modular structure. The main 'cycle' is the decomposition of a complicated system of equations into a series of large and energetically balanced subsystems called modules, according to physical processes. The complete numerical model is determined by the set of split subsystems and approximate the original model with some order of time accuracy. Along with the solution of direct prognostic problems, the method of multicomponent splitting can be efficiently used for solution of four-dimensional problems of observation data variational assimilation. The computing methodology is illustrated by several problems of large-scale ocean circulation, including the problem with four-dimensional variational initialization of hydrophysical fields. {\textcopyright} de Gruyter 2010.},

abstract = {Glaciers in the European Alps play an important role in the hydrological cycle, act as a source for hydroelectricity and have a large touristic importance. The future evolution of these glaciers is driven by surface mass balance and ice flow processes, of which the latter is to date not included explicitly in regional glacier projections for the Alps. Here, we model the future evolution of glaciers in the European Alps with GloGEMflow, an extended version of the Global Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM), in which both surface mass balance and ice flow are explicitly accounted for. The mass balance model is calibrated with glacier-specific geodetic mass balances and forced with high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble. The evolution of the total glacier volume in the coming decades is relatively similar under the various representative concentrations pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5), with volume losses of about 47{\%}-52{\%} in 2050 with respect to 2017. We find that under RCP2.6, the ice loss in the second part of the 21st century is relatively limited and that about one-third (36.8{\%}±11.1{\%}, multi-model mean ±1$\sigma$) of the present-day (2017) ice volume will still be present in 2100. Under a strong warming (RCP8.5) the future evolution of the glaciers is dictated by a substantial increase in surface melt, and glaciers are projected to largely disappear by 2100 (94.4±4.4{\%} volume loss vs. 2017). For a given RCP, differences in future changes are mainly determined by the driving global climate model (GCM), rather than by the RCM, and these differences are larger than those arising from various model parameters (e.g. flow parameters and cross-section parameterisation). We find that under a limited warming, the inclusion of ice dynamics reduces the projected mass loss and that this effect increases with the glacier elevation range, implying that the inclusion of ice dynamics is likely to be important for global glacier evolution projections.},

abstract = {A bulk aerodynamic algorithm is developed for all stability conditions for the computation of ocean surface fluxes. It provides roughness lengths of wind, humidity, and temperature for a wind speed range from 0 to 18 m s-1: z(o) = 0.013u(*)2/g + 0.11$\nu$/u(*) and ln(z(o)/z(ot)) = ln(z(o)/z(oq)) = 2.67Re(*)(1/4) - 2.57 as derived using the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) data constrained by other observations under high wind conditions. Using the TOGA COARE ship data and the multiyear hourly TOGA Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean moored buoy data, intercomparison of six different algorithms, which are widely used in research, operational forecasting, and data reanalysis, shows that algorithms differ significantly in heat and momentum fluxes under both very weak and very strong wind conditions, but agree with each other under moderate wind conditions. Algorithms agree better for wind stress than for heat fluxes. Based on past observations, probable deficiencies in roughness lengths (or neutral exchange coefficients) of some of the algorithms are identified along with possible solutions, and significant issues (particularly the trend of the neutral exchange coefficient for heat with wind speed under strong wind conditions) are raised for future experiments. The vapor pressure reduction of 2{\%} over saline seawater has a significant impact on the computation of surface latent heat flux under strong wind conditions and should be considered in any bulk aerodynamic algorithm.},

abstract = {In this two-part paper, a description is provided of a version of the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model that will serve as a base for a new set of climate and Earth system models (CM4 and ESM4) under development at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). This version, with roughly 100 km horizontal resolution and 33 levels in the vertical, contains an aerosol model that generates aerosol fields from emissions and a “light” chemistry mechanism designed to support the aerosol model but with prescribed ozone. In Part 1, the quality of the simulation in AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) mode—with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice distribution—is described and compared with previous GFDL models and with the CMIP5 archive of AMIP simulations. The model's Cess sensitivity (response in the top-of-atmosphere radiative flux to uniform warming of SSTs) and effective radiative forcing are also presented. In Part 2, the model formulation is described more fully and key sensitivities to aspects of the model formulation are discussed, along with the approach to model tuning.},

Part 2 provides documentation of key components and some sensitivities to choices of model formulation and values of parameters, highlighting the convection parameterization and orographic gravity wave drag. The approach taken to tune the model's clouds to observations is a particular focal point. Care is taken to describe the extent to which aerosol effective forcing and Cess sensitivity have been tuned through the model development process, both of which are relevant to the ability of the model to simulate the evolution of temperatures over the last century when coupled to an ocean model.},

abstract = {A 50-km-resolution GFDL AM4 well captures many aspects of observed atmospheric river (AR) characteristics including the probability density functions of AR length, width, length–width ratio, geographical location, and the magnitude and direction of AR mean vertically integrated vapor transport (IVT), with the model typically producing stronger and narrower ARs than the ERA-Interim results. Despite significant regional biases, the model well reproduces the observed spatial distribution of AR frequency and AR variability in response to large-scale circulation patterns such as El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Northern and Southern Hemisphere annular modes (NAM and SAM), and the Pacific–North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern. For global warming scenarios, in contrast to most previous studies that show a large increase in AR length and width and therefore the occurrence frequency of AR conditions at a given location, this study shows only a modest increase in these quantities. However, the model produces a large increase in strong ARs with the frequency of category 3–5 ARs rising by roughly 100{\%}–300{\%} K21. The global mean AR intensity as well as AR intensity percentiles at most percent ranks increases by 5{\%}–8{\%} K21, roughly consistent with the Clausius–Clapeyron scaling of water vapor. Finally, the results point out the importance of AR IVT thresholds in quantifying modeled AR response to global warming.},

abstract = {The Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) has been extended to include land and ocean carbon cycle components to form an Earth System Model (ESM). The current version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the model components and changes to the previous version, ACCESS-ESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC year-1 for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.87°C.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of radiation schemes on the performance of a climate version of the Weather, Research and Forecasting (CLWRF) model over a domain covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), so often called the Arab domain. The ability of the model to reproduce recent past climate conditions was tested with 30-year simulations that cover the 1981–2010 period. The model was driven by the ERA-Interim reanalyses at a horizontal resolution of 50 km. We explored the sensitivity of the model to the short- and long-wave (LW) radiation parameterizations by testing the RRTMG and CAM3 schemes in order to optimize the model performance as a contribution to the MENA-CORDEX initiative. The results have been compared with gridded surface observational data and satellite measurements for several variables, including mean, maximum and minimum 2-m air temperature, total cloud cover and surface short- and LW radiation fluxes. The model is found to capture reasonably well the inter-annual variability and the observed warming trends over the last three decades. Although we generally found that CAM3 driven simulations are relatively cooler than the RRTMG driven ones, each radiation scheme can give better results depending on the season, location and dominant land use type of each of the model's grid point. The largest discrepancies between these hindcast simulations are found over the desert part of the domain while they are found to closely agree over southern Europe.},
