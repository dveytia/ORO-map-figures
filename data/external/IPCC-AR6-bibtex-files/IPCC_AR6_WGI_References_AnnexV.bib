abstract = {The North American monsoon is an important feature of the atmospheric circulation over the continent, with a research literature that dates back almost 100 years. The authors review the wide range of past and current research dealing with the meteorological and climatological aspects of the North American monsoon, highlighting historical development and major research themes. The domain of the North American monsoon is large, extending over much of the western United States from its region of greatest influence in northwestern Mexico. Regarding the debate over moisture source regions and water vapor advection into southwestern North America, there is general agreement that the bulk of monsoon moisture is advected at low levels from the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California, while the Gulf of Mexico may contribute some upper-level moisture (although mixing occurs over the Sierra Madre Occidental). Surges of low-level moisture from the Gulf of California are a significant part of intraseasonal monsoon variability, and they are associated with the configuration of upper-level midlatitude troughs and tropical easterly waves at the synoptic scale, as well as the presence of low-level jets, a thermal low, and associated dynamics (including the important effects of local topography) at the mesoscale. Seasonally, the gulf surges and the latitudinal position of the midtropospheric subtropical ridge over southwestern North America appear to be responsible for much spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. Interannual variability of the North American monsoon system is high, but it is not strongly linked to El Ni{\~{n}}o or other common sources of interannual circulation variability. Recent mesoscale field measurements gathered during the South-West Area Monsoon Project have highlighted the complex nature of the monsoon-related severe storm environment and associated difficulties in modeling and forecasting.},

abstract = {The Little Dry Season (LDS) of West Africa is manifested as a decline in both the frequency and amount of daily rainfall for a number of weeks halfway through the rainy season. The mean or climatological LDS is derived from the slope of the cumulative percentage graph of 5-day mean rainfall (daily rainfall data between 1961 and 2000). LDS variability analysis was carried out using the concept of relative variability. The results obtained showed that LDS is observed from mid-July to mid-September along the coast. Northward and eastward the period of occurrence decreases. In general, the phenomenon is not observed north of the eastward-flowing or east of the southward-flowing River Niger. The results also show considerable interannual variability. Variability was highest along the southwestern coast and declined inland northward and eastward. Variability was highest with respect to total rainfall, followed by length and number of rain days. There are indications that for most years the LDS was only relatively dry while in certain years it represented a period of drought. The occurrence of the LDS in space and time is explained by the movements of the intertropical discontinuity and its associated zone of rainfall. Interannual variability in occurrence and severity are determined by the Walker Circulation phenomenon. Variability in the severity of the LDS has mixed implications for agricultural practices.},

We introduce a definition for the global monsoon that incorporates its three-dimensional distribution and ultimate causes, emphasizing the direct drive of seasonal pressure system changes on monsoon circulation and depicting the intensity in terms of both circulation and precipitation. We explore the global monsoon climate changes across a wide range of timescales from tectonic to intraseasonal. Common features of the global monsoon are global homogeneity, regional diversity, seasonality, quasi-periodicity, irregularity, instability, and asynchroneity. We emphasize the importance of solar insolation, Earth orbital parameters, underlying surface properties, and land-air-sea interactions for global monsoon dynamics. We discuss the primary driving force of monsoon variability on each timescale and the relationships among dynamics on multiple timescales. Natural processes and anthropogenic impacts are of great significance to the understanding of future global monsoon behavior.},

A distinguishing aspect of this study is the amount of independent data analyzed, such as the newly available European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses, both satellite-derived and station data-based precipitation estimates, and the heating diagnosed from both reanalyses. This also provides a preliminary evaluation and comparison of the newly available NCEP and ECMWF reanalyses at the regional level, including the model-generated precipitation and heating distributions. The principal findings are the following. {\textperiodcentered} The accompaniment of the Mexican monsoon onset by decreased precipitation to the east is shown to be a robust climatological feature. This striking linkage is also evident in the associated tropospheric circulation and, notably, in the upper-level heating fields. The climatological phasing of the precipitation between the two areas is coherent even at the pentad timescale. {\textperiodcentered} While the Mexican monsoon onset is closely associated with thermodynamic favorability, the linkage to the central United States, as reflected in the vertical velocity and the low-level height fields, appears to be consistent with several possible forcings: the monsoon deep heating, the elevated heating of the North American cordillera and plateau, and orographic forcing associated with the seasonal movement of the easterlies encroaching on the North American cordillera. {\textperiodcentered} Although both reanalyses yield a tropical-type deep tropospheric heating distribution in the Mexican monsoon region and, therefore, a potentially prominent role for the monsoon in the regional circulation, the considerable differences in the diagnosed heating vertical structure, thermodynamic balance, and the overall heating magnitude between the two reanalyses, and even between the NCEP reanalysis-consistent heating and the NCEP model-produced heating, suggest potentially significant differences in the implied dynamics of the North American monsoon system.},

abstract = {Global constraints on momentum and energy govern the variability of the rainfall belt in the intertropical convergence zone and the structure of the zonal mean tropical circulation. The continental-scale monsoon systems are also facets of a momentum- and energy-constrained global circulation, but their modern and palaeo variability deviates substantially from that of the inter- tropical convergence zone. The mechanisms underlying deviations from expectations based on the longitudinal mean budgets are neither fully understood nor simulated accurately. We argue that a framework grounded in global constraints on energy and momentum yet encompassing the complexities of monsoon dynamics is needed to identify the causes of the mismatch between theory, models and observations, and ultimately to improve regional climate projections. In a first step towards this goal, dispa- rate regional processes must be distilled into gross measures of energy flow in and out of continents and between the surface and the tropopause, so that monsoon dynamics may be coherently diagnosed across modern and palaeo observations and across idealized and comprehensive simulations. Accounting for zonal asymmetries in the circulation, land/ocean differences in surface fluxes, and the character of convective systems, such a monsoon framework would integrate our understanding at all relevant scales: from the fine details of how moisture and energy are lifted in the updrafts of thunderclouds, up to the global circulations.},

abstract = {The population of the Sahel region of West Africa has approximately doubled in the past 50 years, and could potentially double again by the middle of this century. This has led to the northward expansion of agri- cultural areas at the expense of natural savanna, lead- ing to widespread land use -land cover change (LULCC). Because there is strong evidence of significant surface- atmosphere coupling in this region, one of the main goals of the West African Monsoon Modeling and Evalua- tion project phase II is to provide basic understanding of LULCC on the regional climate, and to evaluate the sensi- tivity of the seasonal variability of the West African Mon- soon to LULCC. The prescribed LULCC is based on the changes from 1950 through 1990, representing a maximum feasible degradation scenario in the past half century. It is applied to 5 state of the art global climate models (GCMs) over a 6-year simulation period. Multiple GCMs are used because the magnitude of the impact of LULCC depends on model-dependent coupling strength between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, the magnitude of the surface biophysical changes, and how the key processes linking the surface with the atmosphere are parameterized within a particular model framework. Land cover maps and sur- face parameters may vary widely among models; therefore a special effort was made to impose consistent biogeo- physical responses of surface parameters to LULCC using a simple experimental setup. The prescribed LULCC cor- responds to degraded vegetation conditions, which mainly cause increases in the Bowen ratio and decreases in the sur- face net radiation, and result in a significant reduction in surface evaporation (upwards of 1 mm day−1 over a large part of the Sahel). This, in turn, mainly leads to less mois- ture convergence and precipitation over the LULCC zone. The overall impact is a rainfall reduction with every model, which ranges across models from 4 to 25 {\%} averaged over the Sahel, and a southward shift of the rainfall peak in three of the five models which evokes a precipitation dipole pat- tern which is consistent with the observed pattern for dry climate anomalies over this region. The African Easterly Jet shifts equator-ward, although the strength of this change varies considerably among the models. In most of the mod- els, the main factor causing diabatic cooling of the upper troposphere and enhanced subsidence over the region of LULCC is the reduction of convective heating ra{\ldots}},

Over West Africa, monsoonal flow dominates with source regions of air from the southwest and east to northeast influencing the trough. As the AEW troughs leave West Africa, flow from the northwest becomes increasingly important. Cluster analysis highlighted that the contribution of trajectories from the northwest increased as the AEW troughs move westward and that this cluster also had high variability in environmental characteristics.},

abstract = {Multi-model mean projections of the Australian summer monsoon show little change in precipitation in a future warmer climate, even under the highest emission scenario. However there is large uncertainty in this projection. To understand the source of this model uncertainty, we divide a set of 33 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) into groups based on their future precipitation projections (“DRY”, “MID” and “WET” terciles). The DRY model mean has the largest sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the western equatorial Pacific, where large increases in precipitation occur. The DRY model mean also has a large cold bias in present day SSTs in this region. The WET model mean has the largest warming in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, with precipitation increases over much of Australia. These results suggest lower confidence for projections of reduced monsoon precipitation due to the influence of model SST biases on the SST warming pattern and precipitation response. The precipitation changes for the DRY and WET models are also decomposed into dynamic and thermodynamic components following the approach of Chadwick et al. (2013). The component due to spatial shifts in the location of convergence and precipitation is responsible for most of the difference between DRY and WET models. As spatial shifts in precipitation are closely associated with patterns of SST change, reducing uncertainty in model SST warming patterns will be crucial to improved projections of Australian monsoon precipitation.$\backslash$nReference:$\backslash$nChadwick, R., I.

The focus is on precipitation and the drivers behind the precipitation biases seen in the simulations of the current climate. Thus, a process-based approach to the question of model fidelity is taken in order to help assess confidence in this suite of simulations. The results show that the regional climate models (RCMs) forced with a reanalysis product and atmosphere-only global climate model(AGCM)time-slice simulations perform reasonably well over the core Mexican and southwest United States regions. Some of the dynamically downscaled simulations do, however, have strong dry biases in Arizona that are related to their inability to develop credible monsoon flow structure over the Gulf of California. When forced with different atmosphere–ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) for the current period, the skill of the RCMs subdivides largely by the skill of the forcing or ‘‘parent''AOGCM.Howthe inherited biases affect theRCMsimulations is investigated. While it is clear that the AOGCMs have a large influence on the RCMs, the authors also demonstrate where the regional models add value to the simulations and discuss the differential credibility of the sixRCMs(17 total simulations), two AGCMtime slices, and fourAOGCMsexamined herein. It is found that in-depth analysis of parentGCMand RCMscenarios can identify a meaningful subset of models that can produce credible simulations of the North American monsoon precipitation. 1.},

abstract = {Coupled ocean–atmosphere variability in the tropical Indian Ocean is explored with a multicentury integration of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Mark 3 climate model, which runs without flux adjustment. Despite the presence of some common deficiencies in this type of coupled model, zonal dipolelike variability is produced. During July through November, the dominant mode of variability of sea surface temperature resembles the observed zonal dipole and has out-of-phase rainfall variations across the Indian Ocean basin, which are as large as those associated with the model El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the positive dipole phase, cold SST anomaly and suppressed rainfall south of the equator on the Sumatra–Java coast drives an anticyclonic circulation anomaly that is consistent with the steady response (Gill model) to a heat sink displaced south of the equator. The northwest–southeast tilting Sumatra–Java coast results in cold sea surface temperature (SST) centered south of the equator, which forces anticylonic winds that are southeasterly along the coast, which thus produces local upwelling, cool SSTs, and promotes more anticylonic winds; on the equator, the easterlies raise the thermocline to the east via upwelling Kelvin waves and deepen the off-equatorial thermocline to the west via off-equatorial downwelling Rossby waves. The model dipole mode exhibits little contemporaneous relationship with the model ENSO; however, this does not imply that it is independent of ENSO. The model dipole often (but not always) develops in the year following El Ni{\~{n}}o. It is triggered by an unrealistic transmission of the model's ENSO discharge phase through the Indonesian passages. In the model, the ENSO discharge Rossby waves arrive at the Sumatra–Java coast some 6 to 9 months after an El Ni{\~{n}}o peaks, causing the majority of model dipole events to peak in the year after an ENSO warm event. In the observed ENSO discharge, Rossby waves arrive at the Australian northwest coast. Thus the model Indian Ocean dipolelike variability is triggered by an unrealistic mechanism. The result highlights the importance of properly representing the transmission of Pacific Rossby waves and Indonesian throughflow in the complex topography of the Indonesian region in coupled climate models.},

abstract = {The North American monsoon is a seasonal shift of upper- and low-level pressure and wind patterns that brings summertime moisture into the southwest United States and ends the late spring wet period in the Great Plains. The interannual variability of the North American monsoon is examined using the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (1948-98). The diurnal and seasonal evolution of 500-mb geopotential height, integrated moisture flux, and integrated moisture flux convergence are constructed using a 5-day running mean for the months May through September. All of the years are used to calculate an average daily Z score that removes the diurnal, seasonal. and intraseasonal variability. The 30-day average Z score centered about the date is correlated with Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) indices associated with the El Ni{\~{o}}-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Pacific oscillation (NPO). These indices are Ni{\~{o}}-3. a North Pacific index, and a Pacific index that combines the previous two. Regional time-evolving precipitation indices for the Southwest and Great Plains, which consider the total number of wet or dry stations in a region, are also correlated with the SSTA indices. The use of nonnormally distributed point source precipitation data is avoided. Teleconnections are computed relative to the climatological evolution of the North American monsoon, rather than to calendar months, thus more accurately accounting for the climatological changes in the large-scale circulation. Tropical and North Pacific SSTs are related to the occurrence of the Pacific Transition and East Pacific teleconnection patterns, respectively, in June and July. A high (low) NPO phase and El Ni{\~{o}} (La Ni{\~{a}}) conditions favor a weaker (stronger) and southward (northward) displaced monsoon ridge. These teleconnection patterns affect the timing and large-scale distribution of monsoon moisture. In the Great Plains, the spring wet season is lengthened (shortened) and early summer rainfall and integrated moisture flux convergence are above (below) average. In the Southwest, monsoon onset is late (early) and early summer rainfall and integrated moisture flux convergence are below (above) average. Relationships with Pacific SSTA indices decay in the later part of the monsoon coincident with weakening of the jet stream across the Pacific and strengthening of the monsoon ridge over North America.

It is found that the Arctic SIC anomalies have little impact on the southern mode of EAWM, but the northern mode is significantly associated with both western and eastern Arctic SIC anomalies. When there is less (more) SIC in eastern (western) Arctic, the EAWM tends to be stronger. The concurrent surface air temperature anomalies are induced both locally due to the direct effect of ice cover and in remote regions through anomalous wind advection. Analysis showed that eastern Arctic SIC anomalies have a larger effect on local atmospheric stability of the lower troposphere than western Arctic SIC anomalies. Winter temperature over the midlatitudes of East Asia is lower when there is more (less) SIC in the western (eastern) Arctic. The atmospheric response to the Arctic SIC anomalies is dominantly barotropic in autumn, and changes to baroclinic over the midlatitudes of Asia, but remains barotropic in other regions in winter. The mid- to high-latitude circulation systems, including the Siberian high, the East Asian trough, and the East Asian westerly jet stream, play important roles in connecting autumn Arctic SIC anomalies and the northern mode of the EAWM variability. No obvious concurrent sea surface temperature anomalies accompany Arctic SIC variations on the interannual time scale, indicating that the Arctic SIC anomalies have independent impacts on the East Asian winter climate.},

The present study distinguishes the interannual variations of the low-latitude and mid- to high-latitude components of the EAWM to gain a better understanding of the characteristics and factors for the EAWM variability. Through composite analysis based on two indices representing the northern and southern components (modes) of the EAWM variability, the present study clearly reveals features unique to the northern and southern mode. The northern mode is associated with changes in the mid- to high-latitude circulation systems, including the Siberian high, the Aleutian low, the East Asian trough, and the East Asian westerly jet stream, whereas the southern mode is closely related to circulation changes over the global tropics, the North Atlantic, and North America. A strong northern mode is accompanied by positive, negative, and positive surface temperature anomalies in the Indochina Peninsula, midlatitude Asia, and northeast Russia, respectively. A strong southern mode features lower temperature over tropics and higher temperature over mid- to high-latitude Asia. While the southern mode is closely related to El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the northern mode does not show an obvious relation to the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) change or to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO) on the interannual time scale.

abstract = {This article discusses the feedbacks between soil moisture and precipitation during the early stages of the South American monsoon. The system achieves maximum precipitation over the southern Amazon basin and the Brazilian highlands during the austral summer. Monsoon changes are associated with the large-scale dynamics, but during its early stages, when the surface is not sufficiently wet, soil moisture anomalies may also modulate the development of precipitation. To investigate this, sensitivity experiments to initial soil moisture conditions were performed using month-long simulations with the regional mesoscale Eta model. Examination of the control simulations shows that they reproduce all major features and magnitudes of the South American circulation and precipitation patterns, particularly those of the monsoon. The surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, as well as precipitation, have a diurnal cycle whose phase is consistent with previous observational studies. The convective inhibition is smallest at the time of the precipitation maximum, but the convective available potential energy exhibits an unrealistic morning maximum that may result from an early boundary layer mixing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Royal Meteorological Society Large climate variations have been detected from paleoclimatic records in some regions of South America during the last 500 years. Among them, the Altiplano and the subtropical Andes regions exhibited wetter-than-normal conditions during the 17th century within the paleoclimatic period known as Little Ice Age (LIA). On the other hand, both regions experienced drier-than-normal conditions in the second part of the 20th century in association with the recent global warming period (GWP). This study provides an assessment of the ability of four models of the third phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP3)/fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments in reproducing those regional rainfall changes and the associated large-scale circulation features. Climate models can represent qualitatively the temperature changes observed in South America in both periods, LIA and GWP, as compared to the control run, but they do not properly describe the associated precipitation changes. However, they can simulate, in some extent, the large-scale circulation changes that previous works identified as important in driving the precipitation changes in both regions. Therefore, the assessment allows to detect the following changes in LIA (GWP): (a) equatorwards (polewards) displacement of the southern branch of the Hadley cell, in turn associated with wetter (drier) conditions in subtropical south America; (b) negative (positive) upper-level zonal wind changes related with positive (negative) December, January and February (DJF) rainfall changes in the Altiplano; and (c) positive (negative) low-level zonal wind changes associated to positive (negative) JJA rainfall changes in the subtropical Andes, being in turn related to hemispheric wind changes resembling a negative (positive) phase of the southern annular mode.},

abstract = {This article analyzes SST remote forcing on the interannual variability of Sahel summer (June–September) moderate (below 75th percentile) and heavy (above 75th percentile) daily precipitation events during the period 1981–2016. Evidence is given that interannual variability of these events is markedly different. The occurrence of moderate daily rainfall events appears to be enhanced by positive SST anomalies over the tropical North Atlantic and Mediterranean, which act to increase low-level moisture advection toward the Sahel from the equatorial and north tropical Atlantic (the opposite holds for negative SSTs anomalies). In contrast, heavy and extreme daily rainfall events seem to be linked to El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Mediterranean variability. Under La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions and a warmer Mediterranean, vertical atmospheric instability is increased over the Sahel and low-level moisture supply from the equatorial Atlantic is enhanced over the area (the reverse is found for opposite-sign SST anomalies). Further evidence suggests that interannual variability of Sahel rainfall is mainly dominated by the extreme events. These results have implications for seasonal forecasting of Sahel moderate and heavy precipitation events based on SST predictors, as significant predictability is found from 1 to 4 months in advance.},

This phenomenon, herein termed the "Mexican monsoon', is described from analyses of monthly mean rainfall, geostationary satellite imagery, and rawinsonde data. In particular, the authors note the geographical extent and magnitude of the summer rains, the rapidity of their onset, and the timing of the month of maximum rainfall.

This study investigated the relationship between the preceding winter ENSO and EASR in the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models and compared the results with those from the CMIP3 models. In general, the CMIP5 models capture the ENSO–EASR relationship more realistically than the CMIP3 models. For instance, approximately two-thirds of the CMIP5 models capture the ENSO–EASR relationship, whereas fewer than one-third of the CMIP3 models capture the relationship. Further investigation suggests that the improvement could be attributed to simulating the physical processes of ENSO's impact on the EASR more realistically in the CMIP5 models, particularly the effect of ENSO on tropical Indian Ocean SST and the effect of Indian Ocean SST anomalies on the atmospheric convection over the Philippine Sea. However, there is large diversity in the ENSO–EASR relationship in the CMIP5 models, and most of the models underestimate the relationship. This underestimation comes from the underestimation of the physical processes, particularly from the underestimated impact of the atmospheric convection over the Philippine Sea on the EASR. The CMIP5 models that capture the ENSO–EASR relationship well (badly) also show high (low) skill in representing the physical processes.},

abstract = {Earth's tropical and subtropical rainbands, such as Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) and monsoons, are complex systems, governed by both large-scale constraints on the atmospheric general circulation and regional interactions with continents and orography, and coupled to the ocean. Monsoons have historically been considered as regional large-scale sea breeze circulations, driven by land-sea contrast. More recently, a perspective has emerged of a Global Monsoon, a global-scale solstitial mode that dominates the annual variation of tropical and subtropical precipitation. This results from the seasonal variation of the global tropical atmospheric overturning and migration of the associated convergence zone. Regional subsystems are embedded in this global monsoon, localized by surface boundary conditions. Parallel with this, much theoretical progress has been made on the fundamental dynamics of the seasonal Hadley cells and convergence zones via the use of hierarchical modeling approaches, including aquaplanets. Here we review the theoretical progress made, and explore the extent to which these advances can help synthesize theory with observations to better understand differing characteristics of regional monsoons and their responses to certain forcings. After summarizing the dynamical and energetic balances that distinguish an ITCZ from a monsoon, we show that this theoretical framework provides strong support for the migrating convergence zone picture and allows constraints on the circulation to be identified via the momentum and energy budgets. Limitations of current theories are discussed, including the need for a better understanding of the influence of zonal asymmetries and transients on the large-scale tropical circulation.},

abstract = {Precipitation, geopotential height, and wind fields from 21 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are examined to determine how well this generation of general circulation models represents the North American monsoon system (NAMS). Results show no improvement since CMIP3 in the magnitude (root-mean-square error and bias) of the mean annual cycle of monthly precipitation over a core monsoon domain, but improvement in the phasing of the seasonal cycle in precipitation is notable. Monsoon onset is early for most models but is clearly visible in daily climatological precipitation, whereas monsoon retreat is highly variable and unclear in daily climatological precipitation. Models that best capture large-scale circulation patterns at a low level usually have realistic representations of the NAMS, but even the best models poorly represent monsoon retreat. Difficulty in reproducing monsoon retreat results from an inaccurate representation of gradients in low-level geopotential height across the larger region, which causes an unrealistic flux of low-level moisture from the tropics into the NAMS region that extends well into the postmonsoon season. Composites of the models with the best and worst representations of the NAMS indicate that adequate representation of the monsoon during the early to midseason can be achieved even with a large-scale circulation pattern bias, as long as the bias is spatially consistent over the larger region influencing monsoon development; in other words, as with monsoon retreat, it is the inaccuracy of the spatial gradients in geopotential height across the larger region that prevents some models from realistic representation of the early and midseason monsoon system.},

abstract = {We exploit the multi-model ensemble produced by phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to synthesize current understanding of external forcing of Sahel rainfall change, past and future, through the lens of oceanic influence. The CMIP5 multi-model mean simulates the twentieth century evolution of Sahel rainfall, including the mid-century decline toward the driest years in the early 1980s and the partial recovery since. We exploit a physical argument linking anthropogenic emissions to the change in the temperature of the sub-tropical North Atlantic Ocean relative to the global tropical oceans to demonstrate indirect attribution of late twentieth century Sahel drought to the unique combination of aerosols and greenhouse gases that characterized the post-World War II period. The subsequent reduction in aerosol emissions around the North Atlantic that resulted from environmental legislation to curb acid rain, occurring as global tropical warming continued unabated, is consistent with the current partial recovery and with projections of future wetting. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) applied to the above-mentioned sea surface temperature (SST) indices provides a succinct description of oceanic influence on Sahel rainfall and reveals the near-orthogonality in the influence of emissions between twentieth and twenty-first centuries: the independent effects of aerosols and greenhouse gases project on the difference of SST indices and explain past variation, while the dominance of greenhouse gases projects on their sum and explains future projection. This result challenges the assumption that because anthropogenic warming had a hand in past Sahel drought, continued warming will result in further drying. In fact, the twenty-first century dominance of greenhouse gases, unchallenged by aerosols, results in projections consistent with warming-induced strengthening of the monsoon, a response that has gained in coherence in CMIP5 compared to prior multi-model exercises.},

abstract = {In this paper the model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to examine the climatology and interannual variability of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). The multimodel ensemble (MME) is able to reproduce reasonably well the circulation features of the EAWM. The simulated surface air temperature still suffers from a cold bias over East Asia, but this bias is reduced compared with CMIP phase 3 models. The intermodel spread is relatively small for the large-scale circulations, but is large for the lower-tropospheric meridional wind and precipitation along the East Asian coast. The interannual variability of the EAWM-related circulations can be captured by most of the models. A general bias is that the simulated variability is slightly weaker than in the observations. Based on a selected dynamic EAWM index, the patterns of the EAWM-related anomalies are well reproduced in MME although the simulated anomalies are slightly weaker than the observations. One general bias is that the northeasterly anomalies over East Asia cannot be captured to the south of 30°N. This bias may arise both from the inadequacies of the EAWM index and from the ability of models to capture the EAWM-related tropical–extratropical interactions. The ENSO–EAWM relationship is then evaluated and about half of the models can successfully capture the observed ENSO–EAWM relationship, including the significant negative correlation between Ni{\~{n}}o-3.4 and EAWM indices and the anomalous anticyclone (or cyclone) over the northwestern Pacific. The success of these models is attributed to the reasonable simulation of both ENSO's spatial structure and its strength of interannual variability.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of two sets of global climate models (GCMs) derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Phase 5 (CMIP5) to represent the summer, winter, and annual precipitation mean patterns in South America south of the equator and in three particular sub-regions, between years 1960 and 1999. Different metrics (relative bias, spatial correlation, RMSE, and relative errors) were calculated and compared between both projects to determine if there has been improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5 models in the representation of regional rainfall. Results from this analysis indicate that for the analysed seasons, precipitation simulated by both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models' ensembles exhibited some differences. In DJF, the relative bias over Amazonia, central South America, eastern Argentina, and Uruguay is reduced in CMIP5 compared with CMIP3. In JJA, the same occurs in some areas of Amazonia. Annual precipitation is also better represented by the CMIP5 than CMIP3 GCMs as they underestimate precipitation to a lesser extent, although in NE Brazil the overestimation values are much larger in CMIP5 than in CMIP3 analysis. In line with previous studies, the multi-model ensembles show the best representation of the observed patterns in most seasons and regions. Only in some cases, single GCMs [MIROC3.2(hires) ? CMIP3? and MIROC4h ? CMIP5] presented better results than the ensemble. The high horizontal resolution of these models suggests that this could be a relevant issue for a more adequate estimation of rainfall at least in the analysed regions.},

abstract = {This study assesses the improvements in climate model (CM) simulations for indicative characteristics representing complex dynamics of Indian summer monsoon rainfall for period 1951–2005 in CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). To our knowledge, this is the first preliminary study which compares the performance of models available in CMIP5 and CMIP6 consortium and their multi-model average (MMA). We find a significant improvement in CMIP6 models in capturing the spatiotemporal pattern of monsoon over Indian landmass, especially in the Western Ghats and North-East foothills of Himalayas. We also show that present-day global warming of 0.6 °C over Indian landmass is remarkably consistent with the changes in annual maximum 1-day precipitation in MMA of CMIP6, which are in agreement with the observations. Our results suggest that added value in CMIP6 models precipitation simulations is not consistent within CMs used in present study. However, it still provides a precedent to the scientific community in performing future studies on climate change impact assessment.},

abstract = {Forecast skill for seasonal mean rainfall across northern Australia is lower during the summer monsoon than in the premonsoon transition season based on 25 years of hindcasts using the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA) coupled model seasonal forecast system. The authors argue that this partly reflects an intrinsic property of the monsoonal system, whereby seasonally varying air–sea interaction in the seas around northern Australia promotes predictability in the premonsoon season and demotes predictability after monsoon onset. Trade easterlies during the premonsoon season support a positive feedback between surface winds, SST, and rainfall, which results in stronger and more persistent SST anomalies to the north of Australia that compliment the remote forcing of Australian rainfall from El Ni{\~{n}}o in the Pacific. After onset of the Australian summer monsoon, this local feedback is not supported in the monsoonal westerly regime, resulting in weaker SST anomalies to the north of Australia and with lower persistence than in the premonsoon season. Importantly, the seasonality of this air–sea interaction is captured in the POAMA forecast model. Furthermore, analysis of perfect model forecasts and forecasts generated by prescribing observed SST results in largely the same conclusion (i.e., significantly lower actual and potential forecast skill during the monsoon), thereby supporting the notion that air–sea interaction contributes to intrinsically lower predictability of rainfall during the monsoon.},

abstract = {[ABSTRACT Time series of seasonal-, monthly, and pentad-mean precipitation are subjected to empirical orthogonal function analysis, regression analysis, and compositing techniques to study the principal modes of interannual and intraseasonal variability of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). The leading principal component (PC) from the summertime seasonal-mean data is associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability while the leading PC from the pentad-mean data is associated with 30–60-day intraseasonal (Madden–Julian) oscillations (MJOs). The leading PC from the monthly mean data is a hybrid of the two above-mentioned modes, capturing aspects of both. The leading PCs are used as reference time series for regressions and composites that reveal the structure of the principal modes and their manifestation in the NAMS. The leading PCs are also used to estimate the fraction of the variance of summer precipitation that is explained by ENSO and by interannual variations of MJO activity. ENSO-related impacts on the NAMS are linked to meridional adjustments of the ITCZ. In its positive polarity, the leading PC of interannual variability is associated with warm (ENSO) episodes and is characterized by an expansion of the ITCZ toward the south, increased precipitation in a zonally oriented band just north of the equator, and decreased precipitation over Mexico and portions of the Caribbean. MJO-related impacts on the NAMS are linked to more regional meridional adjustments in the precipitation pattern over the eastern tropical Pacific. In its positive polarity, the leading PC of intraseasonal variability is associated with an intensification and northward adjustment of the precipitation pattern in the eastern tropical Pacific, with increased precipitation over the warm pool to the west of Mexico and over portions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Both the interannual and intraseasonal modes have well-defined, but distinct, sea level pressure and surface wind signatures in the eastern tropical Pacific. These features extend to the middle troposphere and are capped by circulation features in the opposite sense in the upper troposphere. The relationship of the MJO to the NAMS is examined in more detail using the leading PC of intraseasonal variability and an objective procedure to identify the phase of MJO events. The leading PC is strongly related to the eastward progression of centers of enhanced (reduced) convection around the glo{\ldots}},

abstract = {Key features of the U.S. summer precipitation regime are examined within the context of the evolving North American monsoon system. The focus is on the antecedent and subsequent atmospheric conditions over the conterminous United States relative to the onset of monsoon precipitation over the southwestern United States, which typically begins in early July. The onset of the monsoon in this region is determined using a precipitation index, based on daily observed precipitation for a 31-yr (1963-94) period. Lagged composites of the observed precipitation and various fields from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for the period 1979-94 provide a comprehensive picture of atmospheric conditions during the evolution of the U.S. warm season precipitation regime. The summer precipitation regime is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between precipitation over the Southwest and the Great Plains-northern tier and an in-phase relationship between precipitation over the Southwest and the East Coast. Changes in the upper-tropospheric wind and divergence fields (mean vertical motion) are broadly consistent with the evolution of this precipitation pattern. Enhanced upper-tropospheric divergence in the vicinity and south of the upper-tropospheric monsoon high coincides with enhanced upper-tropospheric easterlies and Mexican monsoon rainfall after onset. Over the Great Plains and along the northern tier, the middle- and upper-tropospheric flow is more convergent and rainfall diminishes after onset to the north and east of the monsoon high. The frequency of occurrence of the Great Plains low-level jet (LLJ) and southerly moisture transport change little during the evolution. However, LLJ-related precipitation is controlled by changes in the large-scale flow related to the North American monsoon system. There is increased upper-tropospheric divergence and precipitation after onset in the vicinity of an "induced" trough over the eastern United States. The pattern of evaporation minus precipitation from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis shows broad consistency with the divergence of the vertically integrated flux of water vapor during the monsoon, although the resolution in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis is inadequate to yield quantitatively accurate regional estimates of these fields. In agreement with earlier studies, the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis indicates that most of the moisture below 850 hPa over the desert Southwest comes from the northern Gulf of California, while most of the moisture {\ldots}},

abstract = {Interannual variability of the North American warm season-precipitation regime is examined in three regions of the United States and Mexico: Arizona-New Mexico, northwest Mexico, and southwest Mexico. Daily observed precipitation over the United States and Mexico for a 26-yr (1963-88) period and various fields from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis are used to compare and contrast hydrologic conditions and atmospheric circulation features associated with early, late, wet, and dry monsoons in each region. Relationships between anomalous monsoon behavior and the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon are examined. Some factors associated with the atmosphere's lower boundary conditions that might influence the interannual variability of the warm season precipitation regime are discussed. The mean seasonal evolution of the North American monsoon system is characterized by the regular northward progression of heavy precipitation from southern Mexico by early June to the southwestern United States by early July. While the seasonal normal rainfall and its variability are largest in southwest Mexico, the mean seasonal percent departure from normal is largest in Arizona-New Mexico. Wet (dry) monsoons in southwest Mexico tend to occur during La Nina (El Ni{\~{n}}o). This association is attributed, in part, to the impact of local sea surface temperature anomalies on the land-sea thermal contrast, hence the strength of the monsoon. There is also a weak association between dry monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico (northwest Mexico) and La Ni{\~{n}}a (El Ni{\~{n}}o). Wet summer monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico tend to follow winters characterized by dry conditions in the southwestern United States and vice versa. Although the onset and duration of the monsoon are quite regular in each region, the precise date of onset in a given region is highly variable and likely to be unrelated to the date of onset in the other regions. Early monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico tend to have heavy seasonal rainfall while late monsoons in northwest Mexico tend to have deficient seasonal rainfall. The onset date in southwest Mexico is not related to seasonal rainfall. However, interannual fluctuations in rainfall over the entire monsoon region for the 2-month period after onset in southwest Mexico are highly correlated, suggesting that knowledge of the starting date in southwest Mexico may be useful for analyzing, understanding, and possibly pred{\ldots}},

abstract = {AbstractThe South American monsoon system (SAMS) is the most important climatic feature in South America. This study focuses on the large-scale characteristics of the SAMS: seasonal amplitudes, onset and demise dates, and durations. Changes in the SAMS are investigated with the gridded precipitation, Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations for two scenarios [“historical” and high-emission representative concentration pathways (rcp8.5)]. Qualitative comparisons with a previous study indicate that some CMIP5 models have significantly improved their representation of the SAMS relative to their CMIP3 versions. Some models exhibit persistent deficiencies in simulating the SAMS. CMIP5 model simulations for the historical experiment show signals of climate change in South America. While the observational data show trends, the period used is too short for final conclusions concerning climate change. Future changes in the SAMS are analyzed with six CMIP5 model simulations of the rcp8.5 high-emission scenario. Most of the simulations show significant increases in seasonal amplitudes, early onsets, late demises, and durations of the SAMS. The simulations for this scenario project a 30{\%} increase in the amplitude from the current level by 2045–50. In addition, the rcp8.5 scenario projects an ensemble mean decrease of 14 days in the onset and 17-day increase in the demise date of the SAMS by 2045–50. The results additionally indicate lack of spatial agreement in model projections of changes in total wet-season precipitation over South America during 2070–2100. The most consistent CMIP5 projections analyzed here are the increase in the total monsoon precipitation over southern Brazil, Uruguay, and northern Argentina.},

The model results show that the global monsoon area defined by the annual range in precipitation is projected to expand mainly over the central to eastern tropical Pacific, the southern Indian Ocean, and eastern Asia. The global monsoon precipitation intensity and the global monsoon total precipitation are also projected to increase. Indices of heavy precipitation are projected to increase much more than those for mean precipitation. Over the Asian monsoon domain, projected changes in extreme precipitation indices are larger than over other monsoon domains, indicating the strong sensitivity of Asian monsoon to global warming. Over the American and African monsoon regions, projected future changes in mean precipitation are rather modest, but those in precipitation extremes are large. Models project that monsoon retreat dates will delay, while onset dates will either advance or show no change, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon season. However, models' limited ability to reproduce the present monsoon climate and the large scatter among the model projections limit the confidence in the results. The projected increase of the global monsoon precipitation can be attributed to an increase of moisture convergence due to increased surface evaporation and water vapor in the air column although offset to a certain extent by the weakening of the monsoon circulation.},

The Pacific–Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern provides a crucial link of high predictability from the tropics to East Asia. Using coupled climate model experiments, we show that the PJ pattern is the atmospheric manifestation of an air–sea coupled mode spanning the Indo-NWP warm pool. The PJ pattern forces the Indian Ocean (IO) via a westward propagating atmospheric Rossby wave. In response, IO sea surface temperature feeds back and reinforces the PJ pattern via a tropospheric Kelvin wave. Ocean coupling increases both the amplitude and temporal persistence of the PJ pattern. Cross-correlation of ocean–atmospheric anomalies confirms the coupled nature of this PJIO mode. The ocean–atmosphere feedback explains why the last echoes of El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation are found in the IO-NWP in the form of the PJIO mode. We demonstrate that the PJIO mode is indeed highly predictable; a characteristic that can enable benefits to society.},

abstract = {Changma, which is a vital part of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system, plays a critical role in modulating water and energy cycles in Korea. Better understanding of its long-term variability and change is therefore a matter of scientific and societal importance. It has been indicated that characteristics of Changma have undergone significant interdecadal changes in association with the mid-1970s global-scale climate shift and the mid-1990s EASM shift. This paper reviews and revisits the characteristics on the long-term changes of Changma focusing on the underlying mechanisms for the changes. The four important features are manifested mainly during the last few decades: 1) mean and extreme rainfalls during Changma period from June to September have been increased with the amplification of diurnal cycle of rainfall, 2) the dry spell between the first and second rainy periods has become shorter, 3) the rainfall amount as well as the number of rainy days during August have significantly increased, probably due to the increase in typhoon landfalls, and 4) the relationship between the Changma rainfall and Western Pacific Subtropical High on interannual time scale has been enhanced. The typhoon contribution to the increase in heavy rainfall is attributable to enhanced interaction between typhoons and midlatitude baroclinic environment. It is noted that the change in the relationship between Changma and the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) over the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans is a key factor in the long-term changes of Changma and EASM. Possible sources for the recent mid-1990s change include 1) the tropical dipole-like SST pattern between the central Pacific and Indo-Pacific region (the global warming hiatus pattern), 2) the recent intensification of tropical SST gradients among the Indian Ocean, the western Pacific, and the eastern Pacific, and 3) the tropical Atlantic SST warming.},

abstract = {The climate of the Western-Himalayan (WH) region is sensitively dependent on precipitation during the winter and early spring months (December-to-April, DJFMA) produced largely by synoptic weather-systems known as “Western Disturbances” (WD), which originate from the Mediterranean region and propagate eastward as troughs and cyclonic lows embedded in the sub-tropical westerlies. While the WH region has witnessed a significant rise in surface temperatures since the post-1950s, there are no major trends in the DJFMA seasonal precipitation. Past studies, based on station observations from the WH, have reported a significant increase in the occurrence of extreme precipitation events in recent decades. Here, we have analyzed multi-source climate datasets to understand the increasing frequency of heavy precipitation events over WH. Our analysis suggests that pronounced warming trends over the Tibetan Plateau in recent decades, arising due to the elevation dependency of the climatic warming signal, have favored enhancement of meridional temperature gradients at middle and upper-tropospheric levels over the sub-tropics and mid-latitudes. The present findings indicate that the observed pattern of mid-tropospheric warming trend in recent decades over west-central Asia has led to increased baroclinic instability of the mean westerly winds, thereby favoring increased variability of WDs and higher propensity of heavy precipitation events over the WH.},

abstract = {The decadal–centennial variations of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the associated rainfall change during the past millennium are simulated using the earth system model developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The model was driven by up-to-date reconstructions of external forcing including the recent low-amplitude estimates of solar variations. Analysis of the simulations indicates that the EASM is generally strong during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP; A.D. 1000–1100) and weak during the Little Ice Age (LIA; A.D. 1600–1700). The monsoon rainband exhibits a meridional tripolar pattern during both epochs. Excessive (deficient) precipitation is found over northern China (35°–42°N, 100°–120°E) but deficient (excessive) precipitation is seen along the Yangtze River valley (27°–34°N, 100°–120°E) during the MWP (LIA). Both similarities and disparities of the rainfall pattern between the model results herein and the proxy data have been compared, and reconstructions from Chinese historical documents and some geological evidence support the results. The changes of the EASM circulation including the subtropical westerly jet stream in the upper troposphere and the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) in the middle and lower troposphere are consistent with the meridional shift of the monsoon rain belt during both epochs. The meridional monsoon circulation changes are accompanied with anomalous southerly (northerly) winds between 20° and 50°N during the MWP (LIA). The land–sea thermal contrast change caused by the effective radiative forcing leads to the MWP and LIA monsoon changes. The “warmer land–colder ocean” anomaly pattern during the MWP favors a stronger monsoon, while the “colder land–warmer ocean” anomaly pattern during the LIA favors a weaker monsoon.},

abstract = {In 2005, southwestern Amazonia experienced the effects of an intense drought that affected life and biodiversity. Several major tributaries as well as parts of the main river itself contained only a fraction of their normal volumes of water, and lakes were drying up. The consequences for local people, animals and the forest itself are impossible to estimate now, but they are likely to be serious. The analyses indicate that the drought was manifested as weak peak river season during autumn to winter as a consequence of a weak summertime season in southwestern Amazonia; the winter season was also accompanied by rainfall that sometimes reached 25{\%} of the climatic value, being anomalously warm and dry and helping in the propagation of fires. Analyses of climatic and hydrological records in Amazonia suggest a broad consensus that the 2005 drought was linked not to El Ni{\~{n}}o as with most previous droughts in the Amazon, but to warming sea surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean.},

Kelvin wave activity is most prominent between the central and eastern Pacific, across Africa, and the Indian Ocean. Composite analysis shows that over sub-Saharan Africa Kelvin wave convection is peaked north of the equator, while the dynamical fields tend to be symmetric with respect to the equator. Convectively coupled Kelvin waves propagate faster over the Pacific and western Atlantic (∼24 m s−1), and slow down over tropical Africa (∼14 m s−1), consistent with stronger coupling between the dynamics and convection over tropical Africa. The Kelvin waves observed over Africa generally propagate into the region from anywhere between the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic, and decay over the eastern Indian Ocean basin.},

abstract = {In this study, a 600-yr integration performed with the Bergen Climate Model (BCM), version 2.0, was used to investigate the impact of strong tropical volcanic eruptions (SVEs) on the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). It is found that SVEs have an important influence on the East Asian winter climate. The volcanic forcing can cause changes in surface heat fluxes and tropospheric circulation, particularly over the tropics and high-latitude regions. As a result, Arctic Oscillation enters into its positive phase in the first two winters after SVEs. The associated circulation weakens the Siberian high and reduces the cold air transport to East Asia, which is not conducive to the enhancement of the EAWM during this period. At the same time, the North Pacific Ocean gradually cools and shapes La Ni{\~{n}}a–like sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the third winter after SVEs. The Walker circulation is strengthened over the Pacific, and two anomalous lower-tropospheric cyclones are located over the South China Sea and southeast of Japan, respectively. Therefore, related northeasterly wind anomalies appear along the East Asian coast, indicating a strengthened EAWM during this period. Meanwhile, the enhanced Siberian high and East Asian trough further contribute to the enhancement of EAWM in the third winter. It is therefore concluded that the SVEs-induced climate changes over the tropical Pacific and north polar regions play an important role in regulating the EAWM in the posteruption winters.},

abstract = {Observations show that the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) experienced an interdecadal weakening in the mid-1980s. This is evident for all members of the EAWM system (i.e., East Asian trough, upper-tropospheric jet stream, and lower-tropospheric monsoon circulation). Here, we investigate the relative contributions of natural (volcanic aerosols and solar variability) and anthropogenic [greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols] forcings to this interdecadal weakening using multiple coupled models within phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The results indicate that in the midtroposphere, the increased GHG concentrations play an important role in weakening the East Asian trough (EAT) by increasing the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the North Pacific. In the upper troposphere, natural external forcings contribute to the observed weakening of the meridional shear of the East Asian jet stream (EAJS) by regulating the meridional temperature gradient (MTG) over the East Asian region. In the lower troposphere, both anthropogenic and natural forcings can weaken the Siberian high during this period. Overall, based on the present analysis of the CMIP5 output, GHGs and natural forcings play key roles in shaping the observed interdecadal weakening of the EAWM during the mid-1980s. Additionally, contributions from internal variability cannot be neglected and require further investigation.},

In this study, we analyse sources of inter-model spread in Sahel precipitation change by decomposing precipitation into its dynamic and thermodynamic terms, using a large set of climate model simulations. Results highlight that model uncertainty is mostly related to the response of the atmospheric circulation to climate change (dynamic changes), while thermodynamic changes are less uncertain among climate models. Uncertainties arise mainly because the models simulate different shifts in atmospheric circulation over West Africa in a warmer climate. We linked the changes in atmospheric circulation to the changes in Sea Surface Temperature, emphasising that the Northern hemispheric temperature gradient is primary to explain uncertainties in Sahel precipitation change. Sources of Sahel precipitation uncertainties are shown to be the same in the new generation of climate models (CMIP6) as in the previous generation of models (CMIP5).},

The new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ensemble provides an opportunity to address the uncertainty in future projections for northern Australia. We find that the range in Australian monsoon projections from the available CMIP6 ensemble is substantially reduced compared to CMIP5, although models continue to disagree on the magnitude and direction of change. While previous CMIP5 studies identified warming in the western equatorial Pacific as important for Australian monsoon projections, here we show that the western Pacific is not strongly connected to northern Australian precipitation changes in the CMIP6 models. By comparing groups of models based on their future projections, we note that the model-to-model differences in Australian monsoon projections are congruent with the zonally averaged precipitation response in the Southern Hemisphere tropics within each model.},

This review deals with the latest research on this topic. Recent Findings: Combined multiple datasets, high-resolution global climate models and regional convection–permitting models provide new insights on the evolution of the North and South American monsoons under global warming, suggesting a precipitation reduction in the North American Monsoon, the southward shift of the core of the South American Monsoon, and precipitation reduction in the Amazon Basin. These changes are accompanied by increased frequency of extreme precipitation events in both monsoon regions. Summary: Uncertainty in the response mechanisms to global warming remains high, especially for the North American monsoon. To make progress, the evaluation of local and remote drives is critical, for which we need a combined use of regional and global models.},

abstract = {Studies of the effects of large volcanic eruptions on regional climate so far have focused mostly on temperature responses. Previous studies using proxy data suggested that coherent droughts over eastern China are associated with explosive low-latitude volcanic eruptions. Here, the authors present an investigation of the responses of summer precipitation over eastern China to large volcanic eruptions through analyzing a 1000-yr global climate model simulation driven by natural and anthropogenic forcing. Superposed epoch analyses of 18 cases of large volcanic eruption indicate that summer precipitation over eastern China significantly decreases in the eruption year and the year after. Model simulation suggests that this reduction of summer precipitation over eastern China can be attributed to a weakening of summer monsoon and a decrease of moisture vapor over tropical oceans caused by large volcanic eruptions.},

abstract = {The South American monsoon system (SAMS) life cycle plays an important role in the distribution and duration of the rainy season mainly over southwestern Amazonia, and the central west and southeast Brazil regions, affecting the economy through impacts on the agriculture and hydrology sectors. In this study a new criterion is applied to identify the monsoon onset and demise that was not used before in the SAMS region. This criterion is based on the atmospheric humidity flux over an area recognized as the monsoon core because of zonal wind reversal and changes in humidity from the transition seasons to summer and winter. Areas in Brazil that have a monsoon regime are identified, and several features associated with the life cycle are discussed. The climatological onset and demise are identified as the end of October and the end of March, respectively, and an interannual variability is found in the times of onset/demise. The main observed features in the two phases are discussed, such as the role of the South Atlantic subtropical high displacement, the northwestern moisture flux east of Andes and from the Atlantic Ocean, the zonal wind intensity and direction over central South America, the vertical motion over the continent, and the expansion/reduction of the Bolivian high circulation with associated high-level divergence. The frontal systems contribute to the pressure decrease, wind direction changes, and soil moisture increase previous to the onset. Low-frequency troughs with intraseasonal variability establish conditions favorable to the monsoon onset, and low-frequency ridges are related to late onset.},

abstract = {This paper examines the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting model forecast to simulate moisture and precipitation during the North American Monsoon GPS Hydrometeorological Network field campaign that took place in 2017. A convective-permitting model configuration performs daily weather forecast simulations for northwestern Mexico and southwestern United States. Model precipitable water vapor (PWV) exhibits wet biases greater than 0.5 mm at the initial forecast hour, and its diurnal cycle is out of phase with time, compared to observations. As a result, the model initiates and terminates precipitation earlier than the satellite and rain gauge measurements, underestimates the westward propagation of the convective systems, and exhibits relatively low forecast skills on the days where strong synoptic-scale forcing features are absent. Sensitivity analysis shows that model PWV in the domain is sensitive to changes in initial PWV at coastal sites, whereas the model precipitation and moisture flux convergence (QCONV) are sensitive to changes in initial PWV at the mountainous sites. Improving the initial physical states, such as PWV, potentially increases the forecast skills.},

abstract = {The understanding and forecasting of persistent dry or wet periods of the West African monsoon (WAM), especially those that occur at the intraseasonal time scale, are crucial to improve food management and disaster mitigation in the Sahel region. In the present study, the authors assess how the 10–25-day intraseasonal variability of convection over the Sahel is related to the recently documented intraseasonal variability of the Saharan heat low (SHL) and the associated extratropical circulation. Strongest and most frequent interactions occur when the SHL intraseasonal fluctuations lead those of convection over the Sahel with a 5-day lag. Using a nonlinear event-based approach, such a combination is shown to concern about one-third of Sahelian dry and wet spells and, in the case of dry spells, to yield convective anomalies that are stronger, last longer by at least 2 days, and reach a larger spatial scale. It is then argued that the 10–25-day intraseasonal variability of convection over the Sahel can be partly explained by the midlatitude intraseasonal variability, through a major role played by the SHL. The anomalous midlevel circulations observed during Sahelian wet and dry events can be shifted from the midlatitudes, which provide a complementary mechanism to that invoking equatorial Rossby wave dynamics. These two mechanisms are likely to interfere together in a constructive or destructive way, leading to high temporal and spatial variability of the Sahelian dry and wet spells.},

abstract = {Abstract. In this paper we assess South American monsoon system (SAMS) variability in the last millennium as depicted by global coupled climate model simulations. High-resolution proxy records for the South American monsoon over this period show a coherent regional picture of a weak monsoon during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and a stronger monsoon during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Due to the small external forcing during the past 1000 years, model simulations do not show very strong temperature anomalies over these two specific periods, which in turn do not translate into clear precipitation anomalies, in contrast with the rainfall reconstructions in South America. Therefore, we used an ad hoc definition of these two periods for each model simulation in order to account for model-specific signals. Thereby, several coherent large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies are identified. The models feature a stronger monsoon during the LIA associated with (i) an enhancement of the rising motion in the SAMS domain in austral summer; (ii) a stronger monsoon-related upper-tropospheric anticyclone; (iii) activation of the South American dipole, which results in a poleward shift of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone; and (iv) a weaker upper-level subtropical jet over South America. The diagnosed changes provide important insights into the mechanisms of these climate anomalies over South America during the past millennium.},

Results show changes in the typical hemispheric circulation pattern associated with SAM, particularly over South America and Australia, between the 1960s–70s and 1980s–90s. In the first decades, the SAM positive phase is associated with an anomalous anticyclonic circulation developed in the southwestern subtropical Atlantic that enhances moisture advection and promotes precipitation increase over southeastern South America (SESA). On the other hand, during the last decades the anticyclonic anomaly induced by the SAM's positive phase covers most of southern South America and the adjacent Atlantic, producing weakened moisture convergence and decreased precipitation over SESA as well as positive temperature anomaly advection over southern South America.},

abstract = {The climatology and interannual variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) simulated by 34 coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are evaluated. To estimate the role of air–sea coupling, 17 CGCMs are compared to their corresponding atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). The climatological low-level monsoon circulation and mei-yu/changma/baiu rainfall band are improved in CGCMs from AGCMs. The improvement is at the cost of the local cold sea surface temperature (SST) biases in CGCMs, since they decrease the surface evaporation and enhance the circulation. The interannual EASM pattern is evaluated by a skill formula and the highest/lowest eight models are selected to investigate the skill origins. The observed Indian Ocean (IO) warming, tropical eastern Indian Ocean (TEIO) rainfall anomalies, and Kelvin wave response are captured well in high-skill models, while these features are not present in low-skill models. Further, the differences in the IO warming between high-skill and low-skill models are rooted in the preceding ENSO simulation. Hence, the IO–western Pacific anticyclone (WPAC) teleconnection is important for CGCMs, similar to AGCMs. However, compared to AGCMs, the TEIO SST anomaly is warmer in CGCMs, since the easterly wind anomalies in the southern flank of the WPAC reduce the climatological monsoon westerlies and decrease the surface evaporation. The warmer TEIO induces the stronger precipitation anomaly and intensifies the teleconnection. Hence, the interannual EASM pattern is better simulated in CGCMs than that in AGCMs.},

The annual cycle of indices based on daily rainfall such as the frequency and the intensity of wet days, the consecutive dry (CDD) and wet (CWD) days, the 95th percentile of daily rainfall (R95), have been assessed. Over both regions, satellite datasets provide more consistent results on the annual cycle of monthly precipitation than on higher-frequency rainfall indices, especially over the Guinean region. By contrast, CMIP5 simulations display much higher uncertainties in both the mean precipitation climatology and higher-frequency indices. Over both regions, most of them overestimate the frequency of wet days. Over the Guinean region, the difficulty of models to represent the bimodality of the annual cycle of precipitation involves systematic biases in the frequency of wet days. Likewise, we found strong uncertainties in the simulation of the CWD and the CDD over both areas. Finally, models generally provide too early (late) onset dates over the Sahel (the Guinean region) and overestimate rainfall during the early and late monsoon phases. These errors are strongly coupled with errors in the latitudinal position of the ITCZ and do not compensate at the annual scale or when considering West Africa as a whole.},

Multidecadal simulations are carried out for present-day and future climate conditions under increased greenhouse gas forcing driven by the global climate model European Center/Hamburg 5 (ECHAM5). Compared to the present day, the future scenario simulation produces drier conditions over the Sahel and wetter conditions over orographic areas. The Sahel drying is accompanied by a weaker monsoon flow, a southward migration and strengthening of the African Easterly Jet, a weakening of the Tropical Easterly Jet, a decrease of the deep core of ascent between the jets, and reduced African Easterly Wave activity. These circulation changes are characteristics of dry periods over the Sahel and are similar to the conditions found in the late twentieth century observed drought over the region. Changes in extreme events suggest that the drier conditions over the Sahel are associated with more frequent occurrences of drought periods. The projected drought over the Sahel is thus physically consistent with changes in the monsoon circulation and the extreme indices (maximum dry spell length and 5 day precipitation).

abstract = {An important goal of the Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) research on the American monsoon systems is to determine the sources and limits of predictability of warm season precipitation, with emphasis on weekly to interannual time scales. This paper reviews recent progress in the understanding of the American monsoon systems and identifies some of the future challenges that remain to improve warm season climate prediction. Much of the recent progress is derived from complementary international programs in North and South America, namely, the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) and the Monsoon Experiment South America (MESA), with the following common objectives: 1) to understand the key components of the American monsoon systems and their variability, 2) to determine the role of these systems in the global water cycle, 3) to improve observational datasets, and 4) to improve simulation and monthly-to-seasonal prediction of the monsoons and regional water resources. Among the recent observational advances highlighted in this paper are new insights into moisture transport processes, description of the structure and variability of the South American low-level jet, and resolution of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the core monsoon regions. NAME and MESA are also driving major efforts in model development and hydrologic applications. Incorporated into the postfield phases of these projects are assessments of atmosphere–land surface interactions and model-based climate predictability experiments. As CLIVAR research on American monsoon systems evolves, a unified view of the climatic processes modulating continental warm season precipitation is beginning to emerge.},

abstract = {[1] Surges of cold air from the Mediterranean into northern Africa during the boreal summer are documented, and their influence on monsoon breaks is analyzed using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall estimates and reanalysis products. Between 1998 and 2006, 6–10 cold air surges occurred each summer, with low‐level temperature anomalies ranging from less than −1 K to over −6 K. Composite analysis indicates that cold air surges over northern Africa persist for 2–10 days and travel equatorward at approximately 5.5 m s–1, which is 0.5–1.5 m s–1 faster than the observed climatological low‐level meridional flow. Northern African cold surges have characteristics similar to surges observed elsewhere in the world, including a hydrostatically induced ridge of surface pressure and an amplified upper tropospheric ridge/trough pattern. The African cold surge is preceded by the passage of a shortwave trough and an intensification of the upper tropospheric subtropical westerly jet streak over the Mediterranean Sea. These events are associated with increased confluence in the jet entrance region over the central Mediterranean, an enhanced direct secondary circulation, subsidence, and low‐level ageostrophic northerly flow over northeastern Africa. Composite analysis shows that the passage of a cold surge is associated with an enhancement in convective activity over southern Algeria, western Niger, northern Mali, and Mauritania 2 to 5 days before the surge reaches the eastern Sahel (∼17.5°N), when northeasterly flow channeled between the Atlas and Ahaggar Mountains strengthens and transports relatively moist air from the western Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic over the region and increases moisture convergence over western Africa north of 20°N. Over the eastern Sahel of Sudan and eastern Chad, the composite results reveal a break in convective activity and decrease in low‐level convergence when the surge arrives that persists for about 6 days. These results offer great promise for improving the short‐range prediction of rainfall over northern Africa.},

abstract = {Abstract. We review the history of the South American summer monsoon (SASM) over the past {\~{}}2000 yr based on high-resolution stable isotope proxies from speleothems, ice cores and lake sediments. Our review is complemented by an analysis of an isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) for the past 130 yr. Proxy records from the monsoon belt in the tropical Andes and SE Brazil show a very coherent behavior over the past 2 millennia with significant decadal to multidecadal variability superimposed on large excursions during three key periods: the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the current warm period (CWP). We interpret these three periods as times when the SASM's mean state was significantly weakened (MCA and CWP) and strengthened (LIA), respectively. During the LIA each of the proxy archives considered contains the most negative {\&}delta;18O values recorded during the entire record length. On the other hand, the monsoon strength is currently rather weak in a 2000-yr historical perspective, rivaled only by the low intensity during the MCA. Our climatic interpretation of these archives is consistent with our isotope-based GCM analysis, which suggests that these sites are sensitive recorders of large-scale monsoon variations. We hypothesize that these centennial-scale climate anomalies were at least partially driven by temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere and in particular over the North Atlantic, leading to a latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ and a change in monsoon intensity (amount of rainfall upstream over the Amazon Basin). This interpretation is supported by several independent records from different proxy archives and modeling studies. Although ENSO is the main forcing for {\&}delta;18O variability over tropical South America on interannual time scales, our results suggest that its influence may be significantly modulated by North Atlantic climate variability on longer time scales. Finally, our analyses indicate that isotopic proxies, because of their ability to integrate climatic information on large spatial scales, could complement more traditional proxies such as tree rings or documentary evidence. Future climate reconstruction efforts could potentially benefit from including isotopic proxies as large-scale predictors in order to better constrain past changes in the atmospheric circulation.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the concept of global monsoon. We demonstrate that the primary climatological features of the tropical precipitation and low-level circulation can be represented by a three-parameter metrics: the annual mean and two major modes of annual variation, namely, a solstitial mode and an equinoctial asymmetric mode. Together, the two major modes of annual cycle account for 84{\%} of the annual variance and they represent the global monsoon. The global monsoon precipitation domain can be delineated by a simple monsoon precipitation index (MPI), which is the local annual range of precipitation (MJJAS minus NDJFM in the Northern Hemisphere and NDJFM minus MJJAS in the Southern Hemisphere) normalized by the annual mean precipitation. The monsoon domain can be defined by annual range exceeding 300 mm and the MPI exceeding 50{\%}. The three-parameter precipitation climatology metrics and global monsoon domain proposed in the present paper provides a valuable objective tool for gauging the climate models' performance on simulation and prediction of the mean climate and annual cycle. The metrics are used to evaluate the precipitation climatol- ogy in three global reanalysis products (ERA40, NCEP2, and JRA25) in terms of their pattern correlation coefficients and root mean square errors with reference to observations. The ensemble mean of the three anal- ysis datasets is considerably superior to any of the individual reanalysis data in representing annual mean, annual cycle, and the global monsoon domain. A major common deficiency is found over the Southeast Asia-Philippine Sea and southeast North America-Caribbean Sea where the east–west land–ocean thermal contrast and meridional hemispheric thermal contrast coexist. It is speculated that the weakness is caused by models' unrealistic representation of Subtropical High and under-represented tropical storm activity, as well as by neglecting atmosphere–ocean interaction in the reanalysis. It is recommended that ensem- ble mean of reanalysis datasets be used for improving global precipitation climatology and water cycle},

It is found that the EAWM experienced a significant weakening around the late 1980s; that is, the EAWM was strong during 1976–87 and became weak after 1988. This leads to an obvious increase in the wintertime surface air temperature as well as a decrease in the frequency of occurrence of cold waves over East Asia. The dynamical process through which the EAWM is weakened is investigated from the perspective of quasi-stationary planetary waves. It is found that both the propagation and amplitude of quasi-stationary planetary waves have experienced obvious interdecadal variations, which are well related to those of the EAWM. Compared to the period 1976–87, the horizontal propagation of quasi-stationary planetary waves after 1988 is enhanced along the low-latitude waveguide in the troposphere, and the upward propagation of waves into the stratosphere is reduced along the polar waveguide. This results in a weakened subtropical jet around 40°N due to the convergence of the Eliassen–Palm flux. The East Asian jet stream is then weakened, leading to the weakening of the EAWM since 1988. In addition, the amplitude of quasi-stationary planetary waves is significantly weakened around 45°N, which is related to the reduced upward propagation of waves from the lower boundary after 1988. This reduced amplitude may weaken both the Siberian high and the Aleutian low, reduce the pressure gradient in between, and then weaken the EAWM. Further analyses indicate that zonal wavenumber 2 plays the dominant role in this process.},

abstract = {Abstract. Monsoon has earned increasing attention from the climate community since the last century, yet only recently have regional monsoons been recognized as a global system. It remains a debated issue, however, as to what extent and at which timescales the global monsoon can be viewed as a major mode of climate variability. For this purpose, a PAGES (Past Global Changes) working group (WG) was set up to investigate the concept of the global monsoon and its future research directions. The WG's synthesis is presented here. On the basis of observation and proxy data, the WG found that the regional monsoons can vary coherently, although not perfectly, at various timescales, varying between interannual, interdecadal, centennial, millennial, orbital and tectonic timescales, conforming to the global monsoon concept across timescales. Within the global monsoon system, each subsystem has its own features, depending on its geographic and topographic conditions. Discrimination between global and regional components in the monsoon system is a key to revealing the driving factors in monsoon variations; hence, the global monsoon concept helps to enhance our understanding and to improve future projections of the regional monsoons. This paper starts with a historical review of the global monsoon concept in both modern and paleo-climatology, and an assessment of monsoon proxies used in regional and global scales. The main body of the paper is devoted to a summary of observation data at various timescales, providing evidence of the coherent global monsoon system. The paper concludes with a projection of future monsoon shifts in a warming world. The synthesis will be followed by a companion paper addressing driving mechanisms and outstanding issues in global monsoon studies.},

This is the second synthesis of the PAGES GM Working Group following the first synthesis “The Global Monsoon across Time Scales: coherent variability of regional monsoons” published in 2014 (Climate of the Past, 10, 2007–2052). Here we introduce the GM as a planetary scale circulation system and give a brief accounting of why it exhibits regional structure. The primary driver of the GM is solar insolation, and the specific features in the underlying surface, such as land-sea distribution, topography, and oceanic circulations, are mainly responsible for the differences among regional monsoon systems. We then analyze the monsoon formation mechanisms, together with the major processes that drive monsoon variations at various timescales, including external forcings and internal feedbacks. On long time scales, external forcings often induce variability on a global scale, whereas short-term variability in regional monsoon systems is usually caused by internal feedbacks within the climate system. Finally, a number of debatable issues are discussed, with an emphasis on time scales beyond the instrumental record. These include the dual nature of the monsoon as wind and rain, the meaning of oxygen isotope in hydrological cycle, in particular of speleothem $\delta$18O, the role of ice-sheet in monsoon variations, etc. In general, the GM as a system comprises a hierarchy of regional and local monsoons with various degrees of similarity, though all show coherent variability driven by a common solar forcing. The goal of the GM concept, therefore, is by no means to replace or diminish research on the regional monsoons, but to help dissect the mechanisms and controlling factors of monsoon variability at various temporal-spatial scales.},

The winter mean surface air temperature variations are dominated by two distinct principal modes that together account for 74{\%} of the total temperature variance. The two modes have notably different circulation structures and sources of variability. The northern mode, characterized by a westward shift of the EA major trough and enhanced surface pressure over central Siberia, represents a cold winter in the northern EA resulting from cold-air intrusion from central Siberia. The southern mode, on the other hand, features a deepening EA trough and increased surface pressure over Mongolia, representing a cold winter south of 40°N resulting from cold-air intrusion from western Mongolia. The cold northern mode is preceded by excessive autumn snow covers over southern Siberia–Mongolia, whereas the cold southern mode is preceded by development of La Ni{\~{n}}a episodes and reduced snow covers over northeast Siberia. These remarkably different spatiotemporal structures and origins are primarily associated with interannual variations. On the decadal or longer time scale their structures are somewhat similar and are preceded by similar autumn sea surface temperature anomalies over the North Atlantic and tropical Indian Ocean. The two modes found for the EA region also represent the winter temperature variability over the entire Asian continent. Thus, study of the predictability of the two modes may shed light on understanding the predictable dynamics of the Asian winter monsoon.},

abstract = {Monsoon rainfall and tropical storms (TSs) impose great impacts on society, yet their seasonal predictions are far from successful. The western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is a prime circulation system affecting East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and western North Pacific TS activities, but the sources of its variability and predictability have not been established. Here we show that the WPSH variation faithfully represents fluctuations of EASM strength (r = –0.92), the total TS days over the subtropical western North Pacific (r = –0.81), and the total number of TSs impacting East Asian coasts (r = –0.76) during 1979–2009. Our numerical experiment results establish that the WPSH variation is primarily controlled by central Pacific cooling/warming and a positive atmosphere-ocean feedback between the WPSH and the Indo-Pacific warm pool oceans. With a physically based empirical model and the state-of-the-art dynamical models, we demonstrate that the WPSH is highly predictable; this predictability creates a promising way for prediction of monsoon and TS. The predictions using the WPSH predictability not only yields substantially improved skills in prediction of the EASM rainfall, but also enables skillful prediction of the TS activities that the current dynamical models fail. Our findings reveal that positive WPSH–ocean interaction can provide a source of climate predictability and highlight the importance of subtropical dynamics in understanding monsoon and TS predictability. Summer monsoons and tropical storms (TSs) affect billions of people's livelihoods over East Asia including China, Japan, Korea, Indo-China peninsula, and Philippines. Prediction of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall and the TS in the western North Pacific (WNP) is a forefront scientific challenge of great societal importance and economic value. The latest assessment of the world-class climate models' performance clearly demonstrates the models' poor skills in prediction of the monsoon rainfall (1) and their inability to predict WNP TS variations. The western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) has profound effects on (and interact with) EASM and WNP TS activities (2⇓⇓⇓–6); it also has far reaching influence on the summer rainfall over the Great Plains of the United States through atmospheric teleconnection (7, 8). Understanding the mechanism and predictability of the WPSH is a prerequisite for better prediction of the EASM and WNP TS. It has been noticed decades ago that an e{\ldots}},

The World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Global Ocean‐Atmosphere‐Land System (GOALS) program seeks to explore predictability of the global climate system through investigation of the major planetary heat sources and sinks, and interactions between them. The Asian‐Australian monsoon system, which undergoes aperiodic and high amplitude variations on intraseasonal, annual, biennial and interannual timescales is a major focus of GOALS. Empirical seasonal forecasts of the monsoon have been made with moderate success for over 100 years. More recent modeling efforts have not been successful. Even simulation of the mean structure of the Asian monsoon has proven elusive and the observed ENSO‐monsoon relationships has been difficult to replicate. Divergence in simulation skill occurs between integrations by different models or between members of ensembles of the same model. This degree of spread is surprising given the relative success of empirical forecast techniques. Two possible explanations are presented: difficulty in modeling the monsoon regions and nonlinear error growth due to regional hydrodynamical instabilities. It is argued that the reconciliation of these explanations is imperative for prediction of the monsoon to be improved. To this end, a thorough description of observed monsoon variability and the physical processes that are thought to be important is presented. Prospects of improving prediction and some strategies that may help achieve improvement are discussed.},

abstract = {The impact of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) on summer rainfall in Southeast China is investigated using the Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) index and the observational rainfall data. A marked transition of rainfall patterns from being enhanced to being suppressed is found in Southeast China (east of 105°E and south of 35°N) on intraseasonal time scales as the MJO convective center moves from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean. The maximum positive and negative anomalies of regional mean rainfall are in excess of 10{\%} relative to the climatological regional mean. Such different rainfall regimes are associated with the corresponding changes in physical fields such as the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), moisture, and vertical motions. When the MJO is mainly over the Indian Ocean, the WPSH shifts farther westward, and the moisture and upward motions in Southeast China are increased. In contrast, when the MJO enters the western Pacific, the WPSH retreats eastward, and the moisture and upward motions in Southeast China are decreased.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Global Monsoons Model Inter-comparison Project (GMMIP) has been endorsed by the panel of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) as one of the participating model inter-comparison projects (MIPs) in the sixth phase of CMIP (CMIP6). The focus of GMMIP is on monsoon climatology, variability, prediction and projection, which is relevant to four of the “Grand Challenges” proposed by the World Climate Research Programme. At present, 21 international modeling groups are committed to joining GMMIP. This overview paper introduces the motivation behind GMMIP and the scientific questions it intends to answer. Three tiers of experiments, of decreasing priority, are designed to examine (a) model skill in simulating the climatology and interannual-to-multidecadal variability of global monsoons forced by the sea surface temperature during historical climate period; (b) the roles of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in driving variations of the global and regional monsoons; and (c) the effects of large orographic terrain on the establishment of the monsoons. The outputs of the CMIP6 Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments (DECK), “historical” simulation and endorsed MIPs will also be used in the diagnostic analysis of GMMIP to give a comprehensive understanding of the roles played by different external forcings, potential improvements in the simulation of monsoon rainfall at high resolution and reproducibility at decadal timescales. The implementation of GMMIP will improve our understanding of the fundamental physics of changes in the global and regional monsoons over the past 140 years and ultimately benefit monsoons prediction and projection in the current century.},

@article{Zhou2009,
abstract = {East Asia is dominated by a typical monsoon climate. The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) exhibits considerable variability on a wide range of time scales during the 20th century. A substantial portion is the multi-decadal variability. Over the recent decades, the EASM has been weakening from the end of the 1970s which results in a “southern China flood and northern China drought” rainfall pattern. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the weakening tendency has been a challenge for climate research community. Examinations on the long-term change of the EASM during the 20th century find no significant trends, indicating the pronounced weakening tendency of the EASM in recent decades is unprecedented. After documenting the prominent features of the interdecadal climate transition, a review is presented in this paper on the proposed explanations to the observed changes. The proposed factors include the Indian Ocean and far western Pacific warming, the tropical central-eastern Pacific warming, the weakening sensible heat source over the Tibetan Plateau, and the aerosol forcing, as well as internal variability. While parts of the monsoon circulation changes can be explained in terms of the proposed mechanisms, it is still beyond the scope of our current knowledge to present a complete picture. Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms that produce such multi-decadal changes in the EASM, but it seems still unclear whether human activities and global warming are playing significant roles.},
