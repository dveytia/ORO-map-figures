Flood defences are commonly deployed to protect communities and property from flooding, but in recent years flood management policy has looked towards solutions that seek to mitigate flood risk at flood-prone sites through targeted interventions throughout the catchment, sometimes using techniques which involve working with natural processes. This paper describes a project to provide a succinct summary of the natural science evidence base concerning the effectiveness of catchment-based ‘natural’ flood management in the UK. The evidence summary is designed to be read by an informed but not technically specialist audience. Each evidence statement is placed into one of four categories describing the nature of the underlying information. The evidence summary forms the appendix to this paper and an annotated bibliography is provided in the electronic supplementary material.},

   url = {https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2019.0550 %X Extreme sub-daily rainfall affects flooding in the UK and urban pollution management. Water utilities in the UK need to understand the characteristics of this rainfall, and how it may change in the future in order to plan for and manage these impacts. There is also significant interest from infrastructure owners and urban authorities exposed to flood risk from short-period, intense rainfall events. This paper describes how UK flood risk guidance incorporates allowances for climate change and how recent research using convection-permitting climate models is helping to inform this guidance. The guidance documents are used by engineers and scientists in the modelling of sewer networks, smaller river catchments and urban drainage areas and provide values to ‘uplift' rainfall event data used as model inputs to reflect climate change model projections. With an increasing focus on continuous simulation modelling using time series rainfall, research into adjusting time series data to reflect future rainfall characteristics in convection-permitting climate models is discussed. Other knowledge gaps for practitioners discussed are the potential changing shape (profile) of future rainfall events and future changes in antecedent wetness conditions. The author explains the challenge of developing simple and effective guidance for practitioners from the complex scientific output. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks’.},

   abstract = {Climate change has an impact on European agriculture in a number of ways. Climate change has already negatively affected the agriculture sector in Europe, and this will continue in the future. Future climate change might also have some positive effects on the sector due to longer growing seasons and more suitable crop conditions. However, the number of extreme events negatively affecting agriculture in Europe is projected to increase. • A cascade of impacts from climate change outside Europe may affect the price, quantity and quality of products, and consequently trade patterns, which in turn may affect agricultural income in Europe. Although fodder and food security in the EU will probably not be an issue, the increase in food demand could exert pressure on food prices in the coming decades. • The EU strategy on adaptation to climate change and the common agricultural policy have enabled adaptation actions in the agriculture sector. The new proposed common agricultural policy for 2021-2027 has adaptation as a clear objective, which could lead to EU Member States having to increase their financing of adaptation measures in the sector.},

   url = {https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2017.1710 %X Many bird species are advancing the timing of their egg-laying in response to a warming climate. Little is known, however, of whether this advancement affects the respective length of the breeding seasons. A meta-analysis of 65 long-term studies of 54 species from the Northern Hemisphere has revealed that within the last 45 years an average population has lengthened the season by 1.4 days per decade, which was independent from changes in mean laying dates. Multi-brooded birds have prolonged their seasons by 4 days per decade, while single-brooded have shortened by 2 days. Changes in season lengths covaried with local climate changes: warming was correlated with prolonged seasons in multi-brooded species, but not in single-brooders. This might be a result of higher ecological flexibility of multi-brooded birds, whereas single brooders may have problems with synchronizing their reproduction with the peak of food resources. Sedentary species and short-distance migrants prolonged their breeding seasons more than long-distance migrants, which probably cannot track conditions at their breeding grounds. We conclude that as long as climate warming continues without major changes in ecological conditions, multi-brooded or sedentary species will probably increase their reproductive output, while the opposite effect may occur in single-brooded or migratory birds.},
