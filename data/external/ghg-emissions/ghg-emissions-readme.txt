Source for the data: 
Our world in data (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions), data downloaded from: https://github.com/owid/co2-data


Notes about the dataset from the github page:
The CSV and XLSX files follow a format of 1 row per location and year. The JSON version is split by country, with an array of yearly records.

The variables represent all of our main data related to CO2 emissions, other greenhouse gas emissions, energy mix, as well as other variables of potential interest.

We will continue to publish updated data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions as it becomes available. Most metrics are published on an annual basis.

A full codebook is made available, with a description and source for each variable in the dataset.

Variables that may be interesting:
- co2
- co2_per_capita
- co2_per_gdp
- ghg_per_capita
- total_ghg
- energy_per_capita
- energy_per_gdp
