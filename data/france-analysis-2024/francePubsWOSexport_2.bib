Abstract = {We have made preliminary simulations in a three-dimensional (3-D) ocean
   model as a means to estimate the time required for CO2 injected into the
   deep ocean to be lost back to the atmosphere. Injections of 0.1 Pg C
   yr-1 were made at seven sites simultaneously. Deep-ocean injection was
   carried out for 100 yeats from the present time under postindustrial
   conditions. After injection, fossil emissions were continued for another
   700 years. Separate simulations were made for permanent sequestration
   (i.e., storage without return to the atmosphere), injection at 1500 m,
   and injection at 3000 m. Two hundred years after the start of injection,
   permanent sequestration is only 80\% efficient. The reason is that
   permanent sequestration results in lower atmospheric CO2, relative to
   the control run, and thus a lower air-sea CO2 flux. Relative to
   permanent sequestration, the 1500-m injection is 82\% as efficient and
   the 3000-m injection is 98\% as efficient, after 200 years. The capacity
   of individual sites to retain injected CO2 varied greatly for injection
   at 1500 m but not at 3000 m. For the 1500 m case, our model predicts
   that injection just offshore of Tokyo is much more efficient than
   injection offshore of New York. That result is just the opposite of what
   has been found in previous work with another 3-D ocean model. Comparison
   of observed and modeled C-14 suggests that for Tokyo, the estimates from
   the two models may bracket real ocean behavior. Further model validation
   and comparison will help discern the key regions and processes where
   model improvements are most necessary.},

Abstract = {Marine land-based fish farms located in coastal wetlands (salt-pond
   zones, lagoon banks, etc.), whether extensive or intensive, send farm
   effluents directly to the sea or after short periods of stocking in
   retention reservoirs. The aims of our investigation have been to compare
   the efficiency of current and potential water treatment procedures in
   open-air. Wastewater retention ponds in commercial farms (Atlantic
   coasts of France) are efficient in removing up to 1 metric ton of
   particulate material (dry weight) per hectare and per day (faeces and
   unconsumed feed), but are inefficient in reducing dissolved wastes, both
   organic (urea, amino acids, protein) and inorganic (total ammonia
   nitrogen, phosphates). Forthcoming outdoor technology to treat these
   forms of waste were examined by trials at different sites: treatment by
   foam fractionation in extensive systems (Italian fish pond culture),
   treatment by microalgae production (Skeletonema costatum) and oyster
   filtration (Crassostrea gigas) in intensive systems (sea bass farm,
   Dicentrarchus labrax). It can be concluded that foam fractionation
   coupled with aeration and water circulation is a good way to treat and
   recirculate wastewaters in extensive systems, but that a multiple
   treatment combining a retention pond, foam fractionation and
   microalgae-bivalve filtration, is the best solution to treat all these
   forms of wastes from intensive systems. (C) Ifremer/Elsevier, Paris.},

Abstract = {The energy balance needed for the transformation of CO2 waste and
   hydrogen into methanol, with the substitution of fossil fuel by
   renewable energy sources in Europe is investigated. In order to compare
   the requirements of different renewable energy technologies a base line
   case of the substitution of a 1 M tons of CO2 has been adopted. This
   annual level of substitution is transformed into an equivalent energy
   requirement to produce methanol that can be utilised as a fuel
   (environmentally CO2 neutral), or as transport vector for H-2 (clean
   secondary energy source) and CO2 oceanic disposal. The concept is
   applied to the European Union that has a highly developed industrial
   infrastructure. An estimate is made of the generating infrastructure
   (e.g. linear coastal length, solar or wind farm area, tidal sites etc.)
   necessary to stabilise emissions by 1 M tons CO2 and compares them to
   presently available energy sources. The study includes wave, wind,
   hydroelectric/tidal, solar energy sources and uses engineering
   characteristics of the different technologies as are pertinent to
   European conditions. Four different energy strategies are investigated.},

Abstract = {A disposal technique for carbon dioxide, consisting of burying solid CO2
   penetrators into the deep seabed has been proposed. The expected weight
   of these penetrators can be as large as 1000 tons with lengths between
   20 to 40m and diameters of 4-5m. In order to produce and dispose of such
   large penetrators, an engineering approach has to be developed to
   investigate the feasibility of the process from the sources (industrial
   and thermal electrical production sites) to the sink (deep marine
   geological formation). A 5 Mt/year CO2 disposal capacity, has been
   selected for the study. This corresponds to a 500 MW(e) coal fired power
   plant assumed to be in the vicinity of a coastal port. The selected
   penetrators are 540 tons weight, approximately 30m high and 4m diameter.
   Two concepts have been investigated. The first consists in producing
   penetrators at a land based factory and then shipping them to a disposal
   site in specially designed ships having the capacity of carrying 148
   penetrators. The second assumes that liquid CO2 can be collected from a
   port facility, transported by a liquid CO2 container ship to a mobile
   marine penetrator production and launching platform. The cost of these
   solutions have not been evaluated in the present work.},

Abstract = {In some few special areas of the world, the range of the variation of

   For centuries man has been harnessing this energy with the operation of

   At present, the design of tidal power does not arise new scientific
   Nevertheless, additional research and development should be carried out
   in three fields: interface of the tidal power station output with
   National Grids and above all a sound assesment of its economic interest,
   design and implementation of the works according to the site,
   environmental effects.
   On November 26, 1966, `'La Rance'' tidal power station was inaugurated
   after 25 years of design in various fields, and 25 years afterwards it
   is still the only industrial prototype of a great size tidal power
   station and it brings us a lot of interesting data.
